It was produced at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, where 175,000 of the electric cars have been manufactured since 2013.
Until earlier this year it was the bestselling electric car ever, before being surpassed by the Tesla Model 3, which sold 300,000 units in 2019 alone.
Nissan previously said that it wanted an eight-strong lineup of electric cars by 2022.

The 500,000th Leaf came off the production line in Magnetic Red paint and is making its way to a customer in Norway. It was produced at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, where 175,000 of the electric cars have been manufactured since 2013.

The Leaf has been around for a decade now, winning several accolades during its tenure on the world’s roads, including World Car of the Year 2011, as well as Car of the Year in Europe and Japan in the same year. Until earlier this year it was the bestselling electric car ever, before being surpassed by the Tesla Model 3, which sold 300,000 units in 2019 alone.

According to Nissan, Leaf owners have driven 14.8bn “clear air kilometres” (9.2bn zero emission miles) since 2010, in the process preventing 2.4bn kg of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere from exhausts.

The Sunderland plant that produced the 500,000th Leaf has had a tumultuous time of late, being spared from closure as part of streamlining plans earlier this year. However, Nissan Boss Ashwani Gupta said that the factory, the UK’s biggest car making plant, could still be in jeopardy due to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

The current version of the Leaf comes with two range options: the standard 40kWh battery, designed for city driving, comes with an estimated 168-mile range, whereas the e+, with a 62kWh battery designed for a longer commute, is rated at 239 miles on a single charge. The basic Acenta spec starts at £26,485.

Although competition to the Leaf was comparatively scarce 10 years ago, the Leaf now acts as the veteran in a rapidly expanding sector of the EV market. Hatchbacks such as the VW ID.3, the Mini Electric and the Peugeot e-208 all vie for the same customers, but now in its second generation, the Leaf can claimed to be a tried and tested family favourite.

Nissan introduced another electric car to its line-up earlier this year in the form of the Ariya, a pure-electric SUV with a claimed range of 310 miles. Nissan previously said that it wanted an eight-strong lineup of electric cars by 2022.

Nissan’s head of electric passenger cars, Helen Perry, said that the company believes people want to make a positive environmental change in their driving habits after seeing air pollution drop over the course of the coronavirus lockdown.

She said: “Consumers have seen what cleaner air and reduced noise pollution feel like during lockdowns,” said Perry. “Now more than ever, they’re looking to take positive steps towards a more sustainable future and the Nissan Leaf contributes to this effort.”

Nissan has a long history of selling sports cars and the GT-R does deserve a hall of fame for what it has really been over the years without much changes. The 370Z, on the other hand, is getting a major overhaul as a concept signalling the arrival of a production model is getting unveiled in the coming weeks.

The enthusiasts of the Nissan GT-R though may have to wait a little longer than expected. According to a Japanese magazine, the next-generation Nissan GT-R is only arriving in 2023. The famed Godzilla will be exiting with a bang though as a commemorative Final Edition will be launched in 2022 and it will reportedly produce a maximum power output of 710 horsepower.

Underlining its exclusivity, Nissan will limit the production of the Final Edition to just 20 units. The GT-R R35’s Final Edition is said to use the same engine as the GT-R50 by Italdesign and it generates a peak torque of 750 Nm. It is powered by a 3.8-litre twin turbocharged V6 engine with several performance upgrades.

The GT-R50 by Italdesign is tuned by Nismo and it uses turbos from GT3 version of the GT-R used on race tracks. It also boasts larger intercoolers. It aids in increased flow in fuel injectors while the six-speed dual clutch automatic transmission and other components have also been upgraded to meet the desired specifications.

The report went on to say that the GT-R R35 Final Edition will cost around 40 million yen (Rs. 2.76 crore) – costlier than the GT-R Nismo but far lesser than the GT-R50 that costs more than a million. Bear in mind, these are just speculations currently but bringing up a Final Edition only makes sense for a car of GT-R iconic status.

As for the next-gen R36 model, reports indicate that the chassis will be adaptable to multiple powertrains, as an all-electric version or a hybrid variant is highly possible using kinetic energy recovery system borrowed from GT-R LM Nismo race car.","<div><img width=""1068"" height=""695"" class=""entry-thumb"" src=""https://gaadiwaadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nissan-gt-r-1-1068x695.jpg"" alt=""nissan gt-r-1"" title=""nissan gt-r-1""><p class=""td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_top td_uid_2_5f6035d958458_rand td_block_template_1 ""><br /> <br /></p><br /><br />   <br /><br /><p class=""gaadi-before-content"" id=""gaadi-1459542553""> <br /> <br /> <br /></p><h2>Nissan GT-R Final Edition will have its production limited to approximately 20 units and it will reportedly launch in 2022 using GT-R50 by Italidesign&#8217;s upgraded V6 powertrain</h2><br /><p>Nissan has a long history of selling sports cars and the GT-R does deserve a hall of fame for what it has really been over the years without much changes.

That's exactly the amount of reading that it took for me to figure out that Matt Ashby is about as true a car enthusiast as anyone will ever be. When you ask someone to help tell the story of their car, you get wildly varied responses. Most people will tell you the specs of their build, maybe tossing in a little excerpt on how they got the car. Sometimes, you'll just get a cold listing of all the parts they've used. Other times, it's a story about the inspiration for their build with very little specifics. Usually they won't dive headfirst into their entire automotive history, though Matt certainly did, and I'm very glad to have listened to his full story firsthand.

Photo 17/17 | JDM S13 Nissan Silvia Wears Latest Pandem Widebody Kit View Photo Gallery (17) Photos

The context into the start of his automotive obsession very much reminds me of myself, my circle of friends and so many of our peers. Just like us, he grew up on magazines like Super Street, anxiously awaiting a new issue, only to flip through it and start all over again. He was immediately hooked on the Fast and the Furious franchise and chose an EK Honda Civic hatchback as his first build. From the one picture I saw, I wouldn't be surprised to pick up an old magazine and see his Civic published in all of its early 2000s glory.

Matt moved on from the Honda scene and got into Euros, some hot rods and even trucks. His resume is quite impressive in the truck world, including a 2017 Ford Super Duty that was featured in the RBP (Rolling Big Power) SEMA booth. If you're picturing a typical SEMA ""BroDozer"" in your head, you're almost correct; the big difference being that his is the kind that's built right. He's a stickler for the details and it shows. When the time came to switch gears back into Japanese cars, he dug deep into his past and drew inspiration from '90s and '00s tuner magazines. It's no surprise that he landed on an S-chassis Nissan, and what better platform than a real JDM S13 Silvia.

This '93 Nissan Silvia Club K's was sourced from importing specialist Driver Motorsports and Matt got to work immediately. It's not an easy task to make an S13 unique these days, so he spent countless hours searching the internet for ideas, finally landing on Hikaru Taguchi's Moontech Silvia as his main inspiration. Showcased at the Tokyo Auto Salon earlier this year, the S13 was one of only a few to sport the Pandem V3 kit at the time. Once Matt decided that this was the look he wanted, he started the monumental task of sourcing the kit. Turns out eBay ended up being the place to find one. The seller assured him that it was authentic and even ended up driving halfway across the country to deliver it. Once he met the seller, Tatsuro Watanabe of HPI Racing, there was no question it was in fact, legit.

The commanding exterior feature of Matt's S13 is the Pandem kit. The matching ducktail and rear wing fit right in with the Origin Lab carbon roof spoiler, carrying that signature aggressive style to the back of the car. Keeping with the carbon accents, he reached out to Bomex and got a set of side mirrors and a front grille made in carbon to match. All of the bodywork is bolted together with burnt titanium hardware from Dress Up Bolts and draped in a two-tone white and purple paint scheme. There's also that livery, made up of a few different layers and inspired by the '90s graphics from Advan and HKS.

If the Pandem kit wasn't enough to set this S-chassis apart, the wheels should seal the deal. When Matt picked up the kit, he knew the matching Pandem 6666 wheels were something he just had to get his hands on, but he couldn't figure out who actually sold or manufactured them. After searching around and coming up short, he reached out to Tatsuro. Turns out, he had a set available, spec'd in 18x9.5"" front, 18x11"" -rear, that would fit the S13 perfectly. Not only that, those massive fenders allow room for a set of 265- and 285-series Federal tires that give the Silvia just enough meat to look functional but not so much that it takes away from the hunkered down stance.

Matt went with a set of Fortune Auto coilovers to tighten up the handling and dial in the ride height. Fortune's air piston lift system was added to help alleviate the stress that comes with an expensive front lip and a lowered car. The S13 has a host of adjustable suspension components from GKTECH and ISR to keep the car planted when driven to the limit, and controllable when sliding around for fun. For a bit more stopping force, 300ZX brakes were retrofitted up front along with StopTech rotors and pads.

The engine is the original 205hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged Red Top SR20DET that features some choice JDM bolt-ons like the GReddy front mount intercooler, Blitz downpipe and HKS blow-off valve, intake and exhaust. Like any good project car, Matt certainly isn't finished with this one. He's looking to pull the motor, clean it up, re-wire, and put just enough upgrades to bring him up to the 300whp mark.

Inside is relatively stock compared to the rest of the car. Matt cites this as an area that will see a bit more attention as the build progresses. For now, it has some S14 seats, a DND Interiors steering wheel, as well as Cusco e-brake and shift boots in matching purple stitching. In addition, there's is a GKTECH carbon fiber gauge pod housing a GReddy boost gauge, and a Likewise shift knob and drift button on the handbrake.

Matt's a tried and true car guy and his experience tells a story of someone who really cares about his hobby. The fact that he can build a SEMA show quality Ford truck, then turn around to build a JDM Silvia that looks straight out of Tokyo is a special kind of feat.

Maxime Bouladier-L’Écuyer, a 32-year-old drag racer and top-speed runner, was trying to set a Canadian top speed record this past weekend at a RaceTheHalf event on an airport circuit near Maniwaki, Quebec.

His car of choice, the OB Prestige Auto Nissan GT-R nicknamed the Alpha Queen, is reputed to pump out nearly 3,300 horsepower at the crankshaft – it’s actually been measured to boast 2,842 hp at the wheels – an incredible feat made possible only because the car’s builders, Chicago’s AMS Performance, have somehow managed to find a way to pump in 77 psi of boost without blowing the twin-turbo V6 to smithereens.

More importantly, certainly for Bouladier-L’Écuyer considering the weekend’s denouement, the Alpha Queen also has a fully NHRA-approved roll cage. So when the AMS Performance Nissan’s chute failed to open – after he had set a Canadian record of 372 km/h, mind you – it tumbled off the end of the half-mile track, ending up on its roof, bodywork severely crumpled and its great honking turbochargers torn asunder.

[UPDATE: The car’s builders, AMS Performance, have since determined that the chutes functioned correctly, but that the driver failed to activate them at the proper time.]

But as its owner, Olivier Benloulou, founder of the Ideal Protein supplement supplier, said, “The car did its job. It won the race. More importantly, it saved the life of our driver.”

“It’s that security cage that made the difference. Without it, the car would have been pulverized into pieces,” he added, not really needing to note how much more serious Bouladier-L’Écuyer’s non-life-threatening injuries might have been without the welded-up high-strength steel bars.

The 30-second clip gives us the opportunity to see the revised Z logo and check out those alloy wheels with a five double-spoke design and Z-branded brake calipers lurking from behind. In case you’re not sure what sort of car you’re looking at, the tires have prominent Nissan and Z lettering on the sidewall that might remain a prototype-only affair.

We also get to hear the roar of the engine, presumably a V6. It’s said to use a twin-turbo 3.0-liter adapted from the Infiniti Q60 Red Sport 400 where it makes 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) of torque, but that remains to be seen. For what it’s worth, Nissan says the Z Proto will be “powerful,” not to mention “iconic” and “retro” as per the video’s description on YouTube.

With still a few days left until the much-awaited debut, we have a feeling Nissan has at least one more teaser prepared for its new rear-wheel-drive coupe.","<div><p>Next Tuesday, September 15 at 8:30 PM EDT, the wraps are finally going to come off the new Z sports car.

Lieberman was a technical advisor for the Fast & Furious franchise and introduced Walker to the GT-R. Back in the day, a handful of R34 models were imported to the U.S. by a company called MotoRex. They were kind enough to loan Walker an R34 and, before long, the actor fell in love with the car and quickly purchased one for himself.

Walker’s former R34 is a V-Spec model in Sonic Silver. Interestingly, Walker didn’t keep it for that long and decided to sell it and buy a white V-Spec II model instead. The car was then sold to a man in Hawaii who set about turning it into a replica of the R34 that MotoRex first loaned Walker, lovingly known as the ‘Blackbird.’ As such, the car was fitted with a C-West bodykit and other custom parts.

Just when you thought the story couldn’t get any more intriguing, the car was later seized from the Hawaiian owner by the DEA and sold at auction to a man in Texas. Currently, it is under the possession of a JDM importer.

According to the FT, this delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered development and changed the company’s priorities. The delay could also give Nissan more time to figure out what to do in case Britain doesn’t secure a post-Brexit deal with the European Union.

Two thirds of the 500,000 cars produced by Nissan in Sunderland annually are Qashqai crossovers.

As for what we may expect from a visual standpoint, the next-gen Qashqai / Rogue Sport will feature similar proportions to its predecessor and will adopt Nissan’s latest design language, meaning a more angular aesthetic, as seen on the latest Juke.

We can also expect a modern dashboard design, with a larger infotainment display and upgraded safety tech.

At this point, it’s not completely clear whether the new Z car will be a production model or, rather, a near-production concept. We expect it to be very close to the final production form of the 370Z’s successor but the said coupe probably won’t hit the market for another 6 to 12 months from now.

Under the hood, the Z Proto will most likely get a version of Nissan’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine. If we have to be completely accurate, it’s Infiniti’s 3.0 V6 we are talking about, which is available with up to 400 horsepower (298 kilowatts) and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) in the Red Sport 400 models. The good news is a six-speed manual gearbox will be offered alongside a seven-speed automatic.

We are not completely sure there won’t be yet another teaser before the big debut tomorrow. If it arrives, we are here to share it with you.

It’s a true blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, with the video showing the driver’s palm resting on top of the car’s shifter. The teaser video is shot in a way that blocks any meaningful view of the said shifter but if you turn down the speed of the playback and you’ll see just a small part of what looks like a manual shifter.

Perhaps this is Nissan’s way of hyping -or confirming- that the new Z will offer a manual option. We can’t be 100 percent sure just yet but we also can’t see why Nissan would do this in a teaser video if they didn’t plan to offer a manual transmission in the new Z.

The upcoming Nissan Z Proto is expected to be a near-production concept of the next-generation sports car, which according to some reports it will hit the market in 2021 and others claim it would launch in late 2022.

The new Nissan Z is reportedly going to be based on a heavily updated version of the 370Z’s platform and will use the company’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine, which makes 400 HP under the bonnet of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400.

Nissan has dropped another teaser video of the upcoming new Z sports car, and this time we can hear its engine rev and see its six-speed manual shifter.

The new Z is expected to be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that could produce up to 400 horsepower.

A concept version, called the ""Z Proto"" will be revealed on September 15.

Nissan will show us a prototype of its new Z sports car, called the Z Proto, on Tuesday next week. It'll take design cues from its predecessors—the original 240Z as well as the 300ZX of the early 1990s—and it's likely to be powered by a version of the engine found in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport. And now we know a little bit of what that engine will sound like, and that the new Z will have a glorious six-speed manual transmission (#SaveTheManuals).

Nissan

That engine is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, which produces either 300 or 400 horsepower in various versions of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60. We're not sure exactly how much power it will make in the Z, but it's possible Nissan will offer a standard model as well as a more powerful NISMO variant. And now we have confirmation that all that power will be sent rearward through a standard six-speed manual transmission.

We'll see and know more about the new Nissan Z sports car when the Z Proto makes its debut on Tuesday, September 15, and the production version should arrive sometime next year. Until then, we'll just keep listening to that twin-turbo six sing and daydream about rowing its gears ourselves.

2023 Nissan Z: Powertrain and Performance

Anticipated to pack a stable of 400 horses, the upcoming 400Z is sure to have the power needed to properly compete with the likes of the Toyota Supra and the Porsche 718 Cayman sports coupes. Look for the new Z to rely on a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 for motivation.

Cribbed from the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400 models, the engine will likely pair with either the Infinitis' seven-speed automatic transmission or a tried-and-true manual gearbox (take that, Supra). Like past Zs, power will get sent exclusively to the coupe's rear wheels.

2023 Nissan Z: Looks and Styling

Look for the new Z's styling to ride the coattails of its predecessors. As such, buyers can anticipate retro cues that evoke the original Datsun 240Z's round headlights, long hood, and stubby rear end. Even the car's badging will embrace an old-school font.

Similarly, we expect the new Z's insides to combine modern technology with design elements that give a nod toward the past. Nissan is sure to fit the car with a trio auxiliary gauges atop its dashboard.

We anticipate the 2023 Nissan Z will reach dealerships in the United States before the end of 2022.

The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort.
We asked one owner the three most important problem issues to look for, and he said, ""Rust, rust, and rust.""
Datsun Z: Through the Years1971 The transmission and rear differential were mildly revised.
What's HotThe original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car.",14/09/2020,"EDITOR'S NOTE: With Nissan slated to unveil a concept version of its next-generation Nissan Z sports car on September 15, we figured you'd enjoy a look back at its progenitor, the Datsun 240Z, from the fall 2010 issue of MotorTrend Classic.

When I was in high school in the 1970s, the Datsun Z was the machine the sports car crowd all wanted, and I was among them. Of course, I wanted mine in groovy root-beer brown metallic with aftermarket slot mags just like those on the pristine example in these photos. My muffler guy had a slick dual-exhaust system all sourced out and ready to go.

The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort. (The Toyota 2000GT was beautiful but rare and expensive.)

See all 18 photos

The Z had it all: Performance, Japanese reliability, an affordable sticker (although dealers did try to mark them up, of course), and all the right hardware. The car magazines raved about them, and so did everyone I knew who owned or was somehow able to test drive one.

Launched initially only as a two-seater, the budget Jaguar E-Type formula was clear and present: long hood, short deck, a revvy overhead-cam six, independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, a four-speed transmission, and full gauges—real sports car credentials. The 2.4-liter SOHC six was an upsized relative of Datsun's robust 2.0-liter I-4. Both are composed of an iron block with an aluminum OHC head; induction came courtesy of dual side-draft Hitachi carbs. The only trans offered in the U.S. was a four-speed manual (other markets got a five-speed, and an optional three-speed automatic showed up in 1971). Although 150 horsepower doesn't sound like much these days, it was plenty for a close-coupled sport coupe weighing around 2,400 pounds.

The interior is handsome enough and comfortable for even the tallest occupants. The switchgear is pure 1970s Japanese, a bit plasticky and the materials are not terribly robust. Dashes are often cracked and covered with a woven mat of some sort. Much of the interior trim is quilted vinyl, which is commonly recovered with carpeting; reproduction kits are available. The factory wood steering wheel is an expensive piece; cracked ones can be repaired.

The aftermarket erupted with body modifications and go-fast goodies. Many early Zs have been heavily modified. It's our suggestion to stay away from these pieces, unless that's your taste and modification is what you intend to do with the car anyway.

Many have been bobbed of their bumpers, and more than a few Chevy V-8s have found their way beneath those long Datsun hoods. It's getting harder to find unmolested, original examples. Good ones command a premium, but they're a value as opposed to trying to bring a clapper back from the dead.

We asked one owner the three most important problem issues to look for, and he said, ""Rust, rust, and rust."" The factory's rustproofing efforts were so-so, and these cars trap water in all kinds of places. The bases of the tailgates rust out, plus the usual spots like doorsills, rocker panels, around the windshields, and the edges of the fenders. Pay more for a rust-free example; it'll be cheaper and nicer in the end. Carburetor linkages can be finicky, and fuse blocks are known to melt down. Modified, overly stiff suspensions can cause cracks in the frame, especially near suspension mounting points.

Z engines love frequent oil changes and a fresh 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water to make sure the iron block and alloy head don't develop corrosion in the cooling system. The shifter is a bit sloppy in its gates, although the trans and clutch are relatively long-lived items if the car hasn't been abused. Clunky suspensions indicate worn bushings, although replacement parts are plentiful.

Back to rust for a moment. Have the car checked to ensure its suspension pickup and mounting points are solid and not rusted away. Installing new shocks, fresh bushings, and wheel bearings in a high-mile car will usually accomplish wonders for ride, handling, and running noise reduction.

Avoid cars that have been crashed and poorly repaired or cheaply repainted. The Z has many subtle body lines, and they often get lost in translation if the car has been oversanded or too-thickly painted.

Factory rolling stock on early 240Zs consisted of 5.5-inch steel wheels with hubcaps. Junkyards were filled with them in the 1970s, although finding clean originals is a little tougher today. Most cars have had a swap to wider, aftermarket rims by now. No problem, but don't go crazy on width; 7.0 inches seems a comfortable maximum so as not to overstress the suspension, increase the steering effort too much, wear the steering system, and/or kill the ride.

Most of the rest of the usual ""buying an old sports car"" rules apply: Find an expert to give the car you're looking at a thorough inspection, plan on some recommissioning expenses, drive, and enjoy. Even though it is not strictly original, many owners recommend installing a strut tower brace in the engine compartment, which connects the front shock towers and adds structural rigidity to the front part of the frame.

These Datsuns were successful race cars, too. Peter Brock's BRE team tore up the West Coast Sports Car Club of America events at the wheel of a Z, and one P.L. Newman, driving for Bob Sharp Racing in Connecticut, did the same on the right coast, as well. Sharp himself won two SCCA national titles aboard Zs.

A tight, crisp 240 still defines the Datsun Z-car experience, and they're sure to be most collectible in the future. Any 240Z in good fettle is great fun and should be a drivable weekend sports car.

Datsun Z: Through the Years

1971 The transmission and rear differential were mildly revised. Optional automatic transmission offered.

1972 Compression ratio was reduced on U.S. models.

1973 The engine and intake systems further revised to meet emissions requirements, and the Z grew larger, rubber-capped bumpers to meet the new crash specs.

1974 The engine was enlarged to 2.6 liters, and the car became the 260Z for one year only. It's still substantially the same piece, but most collectors prefer the more ""pure,"" pre-crash bumper 240s. A new 2+2 body style was offered at the same time.

1975 Another bump in displacement begat the 280Z. This stretched out the original Z's body shape and platform through the 1978 model year. Some of the performance losses were regained via the displacement bump and the addition of fuel injection (280Z only), but the 260s and 280s are heavier and don't feel as spirited and lithe as the first-generation Z.

1979 The original Z is redesigned and renamed the 280ZX. The new car is larger, roomier, and relies more on electronics. T-tops were also offered, although they tended to leak and reduced the chassis structural rigidity. The two-seat and 2+2 body styles continue, running an updated version of the fuel injected 2.8-liter engine that made its debut on the 280Z. The original Zs remain the most highly sought among them, but there is a small but growing groundswell of collector interest in 280ZXs.

Special Datsun Z Models

During the Z-car's production hiatus, Nissan offered a program where it acquired solid 240Zs and contracted with an independent Southern California specialist called Pierre Z to restore them. In 1997, you could buy one through a Nissan dealer; they're identified by a small plaque on the console, just aft of the shifter. The cars were restored to near factory original condition using OEM parts and cost $25,000- $29,000. Or you could bring Nissan your Z, and it would put it through the process. Either way, you got a nearly new 25-year-old car backed by Nissan, and they bring strong prices today if maintained and still in good shape.

What's Hot

The original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car. A good supply of OEM and aftermarket parts are available, and the cars are relatively straightforward to work on. There are several parts companies and shops that specialize in Zs.

What's Not

Many cars have been highly modified, ridden hard, and put away wet (and rusty). Inspect carefully and seek out solid examples. Better cars will cost more up front and be less costly and more enjoyable to own in the long run.

Hot Tip

Pay more if you need to for a car in top condition; you'll save money in the long run.

Avoid

Rusty, previously crashed (hard), and heavily modified cars with engine swap.

Most Collectible Datsun Z

Clean, stock, original 1970 240Z.

Best Performer

Ditto.

Best Daily Driver Datsun Z

Any year 240 works well for moderate duty, although they don't get great fuel mileage—something to consider if you plan to use your 240Z as a daily runner. The '73 model's drivability suffered given revised emissions controls. Some prefer the later 280Z as an everyday driver because the larger displacement and the addition of fuel injection improved cold starts and drivability.

Bottom Line

A Japanese sports car icon then and today, and respected as a classic from a country that doesn't yet have many. Buy the best one you can find and afford. Also makes a great weekend club racer, and minor mods can enhance performance substantially.

Parts and Goodies","<div><p class=""_25GXi"">EDITOR'S NOTE: With Nissan slated to unveil a concept version of <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-2023-nissan-z-everything-we-know/"">its next-generation Nissan Z sports car</a> on September 15, we figured you'd enjoy a look back at its progenitor, the <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/1971-datsun-240z-sale-auction-classic-cars-price/"">Datsun 240Z</a>, from the fall 2010 issue of MotorTrend Classic. </p><p class=""_2sj8T""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">When I was in high school in the 1970s, the <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/vintage-ad-1971-datsun-240z-is-so-pretty-and-potent-356513/"">Datsun Z</a> was the machine the sports car crowd all wanted, and I was among them. Of course, I wanted mine in groovy root-beer brown metallic with aftermarket slot mags just like those on the pristine example in these photos. My muffler guy had a slick dual-exhaust system all sourced out and ready to go.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort. (The <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/1967-toyota-2000gt-sets-auction-record-for-japanese-car-366067/"">Toyota 2000GT</a> was beautiful but rare and expensive.)</p><p class=""lazyload-placeholder""></p><p class=""GR_6-""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">The Z had it all: Performance, Japanese reliability, an affordable sticker (although dealers did try to mark them up, of course), and all the right hardware. The car magazines raved about them, and so did everyone I knew who owned or was somehow able to test drive one.</p><p class=""lazyload-placeholder""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Launched initially only as a two-seater, the budget <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/eagle-lightweight-gt-jaguar-e-type-xk-engine/"">Jaguar E-Type</a> formula was clear and present: long hood, short deck, a revvy overhead-cam six, independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, a four-speed transmission, and full gauges&#8212;real sports car credentials. The 2.4-liter SOHC six was an upsized relative of Datsun's robust 2.0-liter I-4. Both are composed of an iron block with an aluminum OHC head; induction came courtesy of dual side-draft Hitachi carbs. The only trans offered in the U.S. was a four-speed manual (other markets got a five-speed, and an optional three-speed automatic showed up in 1971). Although 150 horsepower doesn't sound like much these days, it was plenty for a close-coupled sport coupe weighing around 2,400 pounds.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">The interior is handsome enough and comfortable for even the tallest occupants. The switchgear is pure 1970s Japanese, a bit plasticky and the materials are not terribly robust. Dashes are often cracked and covered with a woven mat of some sort. Much of the interior trim is quilted vinyl, which is commonly recovered with carpeting; reproduction kits are available. The factory wood steering wheel is an expensive piece; cracked ones can be repaired.</p><p class=""_2sj8T""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">The aftermarket erupted with body modifications and go-fast goodies. Many early Zs have been heavily modified. It's our suggestion to stay away from these pieces, unless that's your taste and modification is what you intend to do with the car anyway.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Many have been bobbed of their bumpers, and more than a few Chevy V-8s have found their way beneath those long Datsun hoods. It's getting harder to find unmolested, original examples. Good ones command a premium, but they're a value as opposed to trying to bring a clapper back from the dead.</p><p class=""lazyload-placeholder""></p><p class=""lazyload-placeholder""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">We asked one owner the three most important problem issues to look for, and he said, ""Rust, rust, and rust."" The factory's rustproofing efforts were so-so, and these cars trap water in all kinds of places. The bases of the tailgates rust out, plus the usual spots like doorsills, rocker panels, around the windshields, and the edges of the fenders. Pay more for a rust-free example; it'll be cheaper and nicer in the end. Carburetor linkages can be finicky, and fuse blocks are known to melt down. Modified, overly stiff suspensions can cause cracks in the frame, especially near suspension mounting points.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Z engines love frequent oil changes and a fresh 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water to make sure the iron block and alloy head don't develop corrosion in the cooling system. The shifter is a bit sloppy in its gates, although the trans and clutch are relatively long-lived items if the car hasn't been abused. Clunky suspensions indicate worn bushings, although replacement parts are plentiful.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Back to rust for a moment. Have the car checked to ensure its suspension pickup and mounting points are solid and not rusted away. Installing new shocks, fresh bushings, and wheel bearings in a high-mile car will usually accomplish wonders for ride, handling, and running noise reduction.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Avoid cars that have been crashed and poorly repaired or cheaply repainted. The Z has many subtle body lines, and they often get lost in translation if the car has been oversanded or too-thickly painted.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Factory rolling stock on early 240Zs consisted of 5.5-inch steel wheels with hubcaps. Junkyards were filled with them in the 1970s, although finding clean originals is a little tougher today. Most cars have had a swap to wider, aftermarket rims by now. No problem, but don't go crazy on width; 7.0 inches seems a comfortable maximum so as not to overstress the suspension, increase the steering effort too much, wear the steering system, and/or kill the ride.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">Most of the rest of the usual ""buying an old sports car"" rules apply: Find an expert to give the car you're looking at a thorough inspection, plan on some recommissioning expenses, drive, and enjoy. Even though it is not strictly original, many owners recommend installing a strut tower brace in the engine compartment, which connects the front shock towers and adds structural rigidity to the front part of the frame.</p><p class=""_2sj8T""></p><p class=""_25GXi"">These Datsuns were successful race cars, too. Peter Brock's BRE team tore up the West Coast Sports Car Club of America events at the wheel of a Z, and one <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/news/racing-career-of-paul-newman-highlighted-in-new-documentary-film/"">P.L. Newman</a>, driving for Bob Sharp Racing in Connecticut, did the same on the right coast, as well. Sharp himself won two SCCA national titles aboard Zs.</p><p class=""_25GXi"">A tight, crisp 240 still defines the Datsun Z-car experience, and they're sure to be most collectible in the future. Any 240Z in good fettle is great fun and should be a drivable weekend sports car.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Datsun Z: Through the Years</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi""><strong>1971</strong> The transmission and rear differential were mildly revised.

According to the report from Best Car Web cited by Motor1, the next GT-R is expected to arrive in 2023.
That means the current car will say goodnight in 2022 with a limited-edition model, again according to the report.
Regardless, it’s likely that this rumored car will cost quite a bit more than the 2021 Nissan GT-R NISMO and its $210,740 price tag.
Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R.",10/09/2020,"A new report out of Japan suggests that the Nissan GT-R, aka Godzilla, will be bowing out the opposite of gracefully with a high-zoot model that will mark the end of this generation.

That same report suggests it will be a bit before any replacement for the flagship performance car will reach the market.

According to the report from Best Car Web cited by Motor1, the next GT-R is expected to arrive in 2023. That means the current car will say goodnight in 2022 with a limited-edition model, again according to the report. If this is true, just 20 units will be produced, all making 710 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque, using the engine from the Italdesign GT-R50. That 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 was massaged by NISMO and the turbos themselves came from the GT3-class GT-R race car.

The intercoolers are larger, the fuel injectors are high-flow, and the six-speed dual-clutch automatic gets beefed up to handle the power.

This car, should it arrive as described, won’t be cheap. Motor1 pegs the car at around $380,000, given Best Car Web’s estimate of much yen this vehicle will cost in Japan and current exchange rates. Those rates will change between now and 2022, of course. Regardless, it’s likely that this rumored car will cost quite a bit more than the 2021 Nissan GT-R NISMO and its $210,740 price tag. That said, the Italdesign car is worth a cool million, so in a sense, you’d be getting that powertrain for a relative bargain.

If the report is true, that is. Speculative reporting on product always requires a bit of skepticism (yes, I know we’re reporting on it, too) for whatever reason. Automakers change plans, sources are wrong, et cetera. It’s also worth noting that the link that takes you to BCW now is all about Subaru, meaning either Motor1 grabbed the wrong link or the piece has been updated.

Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R. Especially as the current car will be a decade and a half old by 2022.

There’s a lot of anticipation for the next GT-R, but the current one could make some waves on the way out the door.

17,17,17,https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nissan-delays-new-qashqais-uk-production-start-more-6-months-report-says,Nissan delays new Qashqai's UK production start,"Nissan has delayed the start of European production of its new Qashqai for more than six months, according to a report.
Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.
Sunderland will become Nissan’s only European plant after the brand shuts its Barcelona factory at the end of the year.
Nissan had planned to shift production of the new generation of the X-Trail midsize SUV to Sunderland but reversed that last year in a decision that was partly interpreted as a lack of confidence in the UK as a production location.
Despite the changes, Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told the French newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Monday the Sunderland plant ""is the best performing of all the Nissan sites.",07/09/2020,"Nissan has delayed the start of European production of its new Qashqai for more than six months, according to a report.

Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.

The delay is largely due to the coronavirus crisis, the report said.

One source told the newspaper that there is a benefit to the delay, which is that it should give Nissan better visibility of the UK's trade relationship with the European Union, which is currently being negotiated following Brexit. The existing agreement expires at the beginning of 2021.

""I don’t think anyone is upset that COVID has pushed it back,"" the source said.

The downside is the delay in replacing Nissan’s top-seller in Europe. The Qashqai has already been losing ground against rivals in the key compact SUV segment, which it has traditionally led.

July sales of the Qashqai fell 27 percent to 13,128, well behind the segment-leading Volkswagen Tiguan at 21,397 and only fractionally ahead of the Peugeot 3008 at 12,699 and the Toyota C-HR at 11,964, figures from market research JATO Dynamics show.

The delay is also a blow to workers at the Sunderland plant, which has been affected by a series of job cuts related both to the slump in demand due to the coronavirus lockdowns and Nissan’s repositioning of the brand in Europe that calls for fewer but more profitable sales.

Nissan eliminated a third shift at the plant last year and does not plan to reinstate it, despite rising demand for the new Juke small SUV made there. The automaker said there was no plan to remove the Qashqai from the plant, despite the company’s warning earlier this year that Sunderland would be ""unsustainable"" if the UK and EU failed to reach a free trade deal, which remains possible given the lack of progress in the negotiations.

""Preparations in Sunderland continue for the launch of the new Qashqai, which represents a 400 million pound (445 million euro) investment in the plant,"" a spokesman told Automotive News Europe. ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

Sunderland will become Nissan’s only European plant after the brand shuts its Barcelona factory at the end of the year.

Nissan had planned to shift production of the new generation of the X-Trail midsize SUV to Sunderland but reversed that last year in a decision that was partly interpreted as a lack of confidence in the UK as a production location. The X-Trail will be built only in Japan.

The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn Tuesday when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former aide Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for a businessman once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But lost in the small print was the same-day arrest of Kelly, and with Ghosn now in Lebanon as an international fugitive after jumping bail and fleeing Japan last year the American lawyer is the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

He faces a single charge -- conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 Tuesday and is out on bail living in an aparftment in Tokyo, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question fraught with technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Vast amounts of evidence

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast trove of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted -- despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.

The upcoming Nissan Magnite sub-4m compact crossover is currently undergoing an intensive testing regime to get ready for an early 2021 launch. The mini SUV which will slot below the Kicks as the company’s most affordable model in the country will be aiming to be a turnaround specialist.

Exterior and Interior Design

Thanks to leaked patent images of the production spec Nissan Magnite, we now have a better idea about the car’s design. In addition, Nissan had recently previewed the Magnite via a set of concept images. With its edgy exterior design elements and uncluttered interior layout, the crossover targets young urban audience.

The design actually originates from the Datsun Go-Cross concept which world premiered at 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. Owing to the budget brand’s poor show, the low-cost Datsun SUV failed to meet the assembly line. The Nissan Magnite is essentially a more upmarket take on the Go-Cross concept.

Platform

The Nissan Magnite SUV is underpinned by Renault-Nissan Alliance’s CMF-A+ platform which will cater to emerging market-specific products. The upcoming Nissan crossover will share its platform with the Renault Kiger which is also currently undergoing testing.

Both these products together will shoulder the responsibility of powering Renault-Nissan Alliance out of its rough patch in India. Moreover, Nissan’s future plans for India hinges on how successful the Magnite is going to be.

Powertrain

There is no official confirmation about the Nissan Magnite’s powertrain options but a 1.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine is reported to be the viable candidate. With an estimated output of 100 hp and 160 Nm of torque, the motor will be at par with the segment rivals. We expect both manual and automatic transmission options to be on offer right from day one.

With BS6 emission standards warranting expensive fixes to diesel engines, the Alliance has opted to discontinue its famed 1.5-liter dCi motor. So, like the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Nissan Magnite will be a petrol-only SUV.

Rivals and launch

In addition to Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Magnite will have to fight it out with an array of well rounded compact crossovers like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Ford EcoSport, and its own sibling, the Kiger.

Scheduled to be launched sometime in the first half of 2021, the Nissan Magnite will be heavily localized to arrive at a competitive price point. While the competition is going to be intense, the sub-4m SUV segment is also growing at a brisk rate. Will the Nissan SUV crack it?

Moreover, Nissan&#8217;s future plans for India hinges on <a href=""https://www.rushlane.com/magnite-suv-nissans-future-in-india-12369907.html"">how successful the Magnite</a> is going to be.</p><br /><h3>Powertrain</h3><br /><p>There is no official confirmation about the Nissan Magnite&#8217;s powertrain options but a 1.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine is reported to be the viable candidate. With an estimated output of 100 hp and 160 Nm of torque, the motor will be at par with the segment rivals. We expect both manual and automatic transmission options to be on offer right from day one.</p><br /><p><img src=""https://www.rushlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nissan-magnite-patent-images-leak-1-600x337.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Magnite Patent Images"" width=""600"" height=""337"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-375506""></p><br /><p>With BS6 emission standards warranting expensive fixes to diesel engines, the Alliance has opted to discontinue its famed 1.5-liter dCi motor. So, like the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Nissan Magnite will be a petrol-only SUV.</p><br /><h3>Rivals and launch</h3><br /><p><img src=""https://www.rushlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nissan-magnite-patent-images-leak-3-600x450.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Magnite Patent Images"" width=""600"" height=""450"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-375508""></p><br /><p>In addition to Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Magnite will have to fight it out with an array of well rounded compact crossovers like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Ford EcoSport, and its own sibling, the <a href=""https://www.rushlane.com/renault-kiger-side-view-spied-testing-launch-date-12366066.html"">Kiger</a>.</p><br /><p>Scheduled to be launched sometime in the <strong>first half of 2021</strong>, the Nissan Magnite will be heavily localized to arrive at a competitive price point. While the competition is going to be intense, the sub-4m SUV segment is also growing at a brisk rate.

We’ve already said that Nissan hasn’t left itself much time to squeeze in the de riguer new car teaser campaign for the ‘Z-Proto‘. But the Japanese manufacturer is damn well trying - the titbits of information are coming thick and fast ahead of the concept’s 16 September reveal. We’ve already seen Nissan vice president of design Alfonso Albaisa show a design sketch of the car’s 300ZX-like rear end, and a couple of days ago there was yet another teaser we ignored since it didn’t really reveal anything new. This latest one for the Z-Proto - a concept which previews the 370Z-replacing ‘400Z’ - is a little more significant, however.

Expect the tyre lettering to disappear when the production version arrives...

We get a clear shot of the centre console, revealing a manual gearbox. As a bonus, we can also see a manual handbrake - remember those? Meanwhile, up and to the right, there’s what looks to be a button to activate an auto rev-matching feature, as also found in the 370Z. There are some brief shots of the exterior as a bonus, giving a glimpse of the coupe’s wheels. Want to buy a Nissan?

As we revealed earlier this month, Mazda switched sourcing the CX-30 from Thailand to Japan beginning from July production in a move designed to shield the small SUV range from fluctuating currency issues.
For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.
Mazda’s decision to include a manual gearbox model in the CX-30 makes it a rarity among small SUVs, since – out of over 20 models – only a handful follow suit.
These include the Mitsubishi ASX ES (from $23,990), Nissan Qashqai ST (from $28,290), Suzuki Vitara (from $22,990), Skoda Kamiq 85TSI (from $26,990) and Fiat 500X Pop (from $24,990).",15/09/2020,"The strong-selling Mazda CX-30 for 2021 kicks off from a lower price point than before, thanks to an expanded model line-up that now includes a manual transmission option for the first time.

With stock arriving in dealers this month, the CX-30 is now expected to start from $28,990 before on-road costs, meaning that the base Pure grade with a six-speed manual gearbox would represent a $1000 saving over the six-speed automatic alternative with the same G20 2.0-litre four-cylinder front-wheel-drive configuration.

The manual gearbox will not be available on any other grade above Pure, leaving the rest of the range (G20 FWD in Evolve, Touring and Astina, G25 FWD in Touring and Astina, all-wheel-drive G25 Touring, Astina, and X20 Astina 2.0-litre supercharged compression-ignition engined models) as auto-only propositions.

For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.

Along with a lower starting price, the G20 Pure manual brings slightly different fuel consumption figures; while its published 6.5 litres per 100km on the combined cycle is the same as the G20 auto equivalent, it uses 0.2L/100km less petrol on the extra urban cycle but 0.3L/100km more in the city cycle. Kerb weight also falls by 24kg to 1418kg.

In the past, and despite often representing less than five per cent of overall Mazda sales volumes, the Hiroshima-based company has stated that manual transmissions are important in adhering to the company’s driver-focused ‘Zoom-Zoom’ philosophy.","<div><p>The strong-selling Mazda CX-30 for 2021 kicks off from a lower price point than before, thanks to an expanded model line-up that now includes a manual transmission option for the first time.</p><p>With stock arriving in dealers this month, <a href=""/mazda/cx-30"">the CX-30</a> is now expected to start from $28,990 before on-road costs, meaning that the base Pure grade with a <a href=""/car-advice/why-autos-are-so-popular-but-a-manual-is-still-often-best-35366"">six-speed manual gearbox</a> would represent a $1000 saving over the <a href=""/car-advice/torque-converter-cvt-dual-or-single-clutch-autos-whats-the-difference-33411"">six-speed automatic</a> alternative with the same G20 2.0-litre four-cylinder <a href=""/car-advice/why-front-wheel-drive-is-sensible-but-rear-wheel-drive-is-more-fun-36990"">front-wheel-drive</a> configuration.</p><p>The manual gearbox will not be available on any other grade above Pure, leaving the rest of the range (G20 FWD in Evolve, Touring and Astina, G25 FWD in Touring and Astina, <a href=""/car-advice/all-wheel-or-four-wheel-drive-whats-the-difference-33194"">all-wheel-drive</a> G25 Touring, Astina, and X20 Astina 2.0-litre supercharged compression-ignition engined models) as auto-only propositions.</p><p>As we revealed earlier this month, <a href=""/mazda"">Mazda</a> switched sourcing the CX-30 from Thailand to Japan beginning from July production in a move designed to shield the <a href=""/suv/small-suvs"">small SUV range</a> from fluctuating currency issues.</p><p>For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.</p><p>Along with a lower starting price, the G20 Pure manual brings slightly different fuel consumption figures; while its published <a href=""/car-advice/fuel-efficiency-ratings-what-do-they-tell-you-31319"">6.5 litres per 100km</a> on the combined cycle is the same as the G20 auto equivalent, it uses 0.2L/100km less petrol on the extra urban cycle but 0.3L/100km more in the city cycle.

I attended a local Southern California car meet a couple of weeks ago when I had a revelation about Nissan's third generation Skyline GT-R: they're everywhere! I legit saw more JDM R32 GT-Rs than Scions or Civics. We can credit this to the recent ruling passed a few years ago that allows any imported car 25 years or older to be exempt from National Traffic Highway Safety Administration regulations (don't forget to read our guide to importing a JDM car). Since then, it's quite common for every container sailing in from Japan to have an assortment of used and semi-abused right-hand-drive R32 Skylines, which in turn has filled the market with a healthy amount of them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating, and I still get a little giddy every time I see one on the road. Perhaps what I'm trying to say is that since the GT-R was every JDM fanboys dream car and they're now legal and affordable to own ($32,500 can get you something really nice on BringATrailer.com), if you're going to want to standout as an R32 owner these days, then you're going to have to go above and beyond, which is exactly what Orlando Villalobos did with his 1989 Skyline GT-R.

Originally from Corpus Christi, Texas, Orlando is now a master sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Group A '80s and '90s touring cars were always his thing from playing the original Gran Turismo, so he gravitated to the all-wheel-drive GT-R over the likes of the Toyota Supra and Ford Sierra; however, it wasn't until he was much older that he would finally be able to fulfill his childhood fantasy and own one in America.

On the outside, his GT-R looks every bit like it's ready to battle on Tsukuba Circuit (interestingly, Orlando's Voltex rear wing was sourced from a retired racecar that previously put down rocket-fast lap times at Fuji Speedway). There's a laundry list of dope JDM parts that make this car very authentic; however, it's what's underneath that makes it truly special. Modern-day reliability and 500+whp performance help make this 31-year-old project car more impressive than the dated Group A racecars Orlando once envied decades ago.

Can this RB26DETT handle more power than what it's putting down now? You bet it can. Orlando explains the engine and fuel system can withstand up to 800whp. For now, he intends to improve his driving skills and learn the car more at local track days before swapping to a larger turbo. ""I love the allure of challenging myself and racing the clock to see if I can best myself. This is a form of personal advancement and I feel we can all use a little personal accountability to become better in life where possible.""

Before I sign off, there is an untold story that Orlando wants people to know. The journey toward obtaining and building his dream car was far from easy. He's reminded every instance he gets behind the wheel to never take life for granted, and that we shouldn't either. I'll let Orlando take the stage...

LIVING A LIFE OF NO REGRETS

""In 2010 I was deployed to Afghanistan. It was a rough deployment that I had never experienced in the previous four years I had been in. I had been blown up and shot at multiple times. After I lost a mentor of mine, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Master Sergeant Daniel Fedder, I realized how fragile and short life was. I told myself I would begin living life with less regrets and that I would do things I always said I would. Owning my dream car, the Skyline GT-R (obsessed about it since the Gran Turismo days), was one of those things.

ULTIMATE FIND CLOSE TO HOME

During days back on the base, I started searching on the internet for one. Ironically, one popped up in the larger city neighboring my hometown, Corpus Christi, Texas. When I called from an iridium satellite phone, the owner and now friend, Josh ""Joshiroku"" Garcia saw the crazy number and hung up on me thinking I was just another tire kicker. Days later, my parents got in touch with him and informed him that I was indeed real and had intentions of owning the car. Josh, who also had family in the military, told my parents he would take them for a test drive and would hold the car for me until I decided I wanted it. Naturally, I did, so my parents handed him a check within that week and the car then belonged to me.

CURSED R32

It was fairly stock appearing but also had a semi-built engine and BCNR33 Brembo brakes. It also had a some very nice gold BBS LM wheels that had been acquired by someone who unfortunately had an untimely death about a week after the wheel transaction. That was when I should've known the car had a curse...

NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE

Three days after I returned from Afghanistan and started driving the car, I lost control driving at a moderately low speed while taking a very easy curve. There was no reason the car should've lost control. HICAS had been blocked out and there was no oil or debris on the road. The car tried to kill me. The car bounced around and I somehow shortly developed rod knock.

THE CURSE STRIKES AGAIN

Not long after, I received orders to move to Okinawa. The car sat while I went overseas to Okinawa, Korea, Philippines, and lived in Dubai for a year before returning back to Okinawa and eventually moving back to California in 2014. While working in Dubai, Josh Garcia, whom I purchased the car from, swapped in a BCNR33 engine and helped with some of the current aero. After getting situated in California, the car was shipped out to me; that's when the curse struck again. The enclosed trailer transport driver got a flat tire and while changing the flat on his truck, somehow the truck fell off the jack stands and crushed him to death.

FOWL PLAY

Weeks later, the car was picked up and delivered by another individual where it seldomly was driven. While preparing for yet another deployment in 2015, I trusted the car with an 'RB specialist' that I was introduced to. He was to change belts and fluids and prepare the car for a seven-month storage, but instead, he drove the car 'like he stole it' and returned it back to me with rod knock. I couldn't do much, so I stored the car and eventually nearly lost all motivation in getting it running again. It bounced from one failed shop to another and everything else in between.

BARDABE SAVES THE DAY

In 2018, I met Juan Vargas, owner of Bardabe Performance (now located in Austin, Texas) and things finally started to look up. Juan helped me with planning to achieve my goals of a safe, responsive, and overengineered car. I wanted to stabilize the car so its tail wouldn't fly out from behind it. I wanted a responsive and strong car so it wouldn't have the unfortunate rod knock again.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

In December of 2019, after waiting months for an N1 block, its single turbo conversion, all the amazing hard lines, custom fuel system, wiring harness and Leask-Spec advanced cooling system, the car was ready to break its curse. Juan was dead set on eliminating any future failures, like oil lines that usually fail on the super-hot running RBs. He was persistent to see me actually fully enjoy the car since he had seen how long it had been off the road due to other's lack of care previously.

POSITIVE FUTURE

The plan is now to retain a street tamed car that can conquer any obstacle thrown at it and with zero failures. Future goals are to upgrade to a BNR34 six-speed GETRAG transmission and updated, stronger arms and sway bars. Eventually the car will be ready for track events, but for the time being it'll remain a daily reminder of how life is too short to not enjoy, and how all 'curses' and bad luck can be overcome with the right people pushing you in the right direction."" - Orlando Villalobos

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Read: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn gone, American Kelly faces Japan trial alone

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.","<div><p>&#160;The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.</p><p>Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.</p><p>And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.</p><p><strong>Read:&#160;<a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/nissans-carlos-ghosn-gone-american-kelly-faces-japan-trial-alone-882325.html"" target=""_blank"">Nissan's Carlos Ghosn gone, American Kelly faces Japan trial alone</a></strong></p><p>The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.</p><p>Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing.

The rear end is heavily disguised, but it appears pretty evolutionary. However, the model appears to adopt slimmer taillights and a wider third brake light.

Bigger changes occur inside as the cabin is far more modern and high-tech than its predecessor. While the steering wheels looks pretty familiar, there’s a new digital instrument and a free-standing infotainment system. We can also see new climate controls and what appears to be a push-button shifter.

Specifications remain a mystery, but the crossover is slated to ride on the CMF-C/D platform and be offered with an assortment of turbocharged petrol engines. The diesel engines will reportedly be dropped, but there could be eco-friendly alternatives in the form of plug-in hybrid and range-extended EV options.

Nissan hasn’t said much about the Qashqai, but recent reports have suggested the crossover has been delayed until mid-2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. That remains unconfirmed, but the company said they’ll have more to share in the coming months.

Of course, we can also expect the crossover to arrive stateside as the next-generation Rogue Sport.

So I created the ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Upgrades / 3rd Party / Aftermarket / EV’ Group on Facebook.
The number one term that people searched for was ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Replacement’ and that's why I chose that name.
I also own ‘Nissan LEAF battery Installers.’”Cameli bought the domain on August 17, 2020, and the site went live on August 26, 2020.
That shows the potential aftermarket companies dedicated to keeping electric cars running may become a fantastic business opportunity.",15/09/2020,"Real heroes can be regular people, such as Sal Cameli. He goes through a lot to support electric car adoption. The video above shows the process Cameli adopts to be able to charge his Nissan Leaf. His other heroic act in helping get more people into EVs is a world map he has created to help other Leaf owners to replace the batteries in their cars. And you can help him make it even better.

Cameli came up with the idea of creating NissanLeafBatteryReplacement.com to help Leaf owner back in February 2018, as he told InsideEVs:

“Back then, I heard of a company named MUXSAN. They were swapping out LEAF battery packs and I figured it would be good to have a Facebook group to discuss this with other LEAF owners. So I created the ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Upgrades / 3rd Party / Aftermarket / EV’ Group on Facebook. On that group, I started a pinned post with a listing of aftermarket LEAF Battery Mechanics on January 28, 2020, and the list grew to 18 installers & suppliers until August of this year.”

That was when people that were not on Facebook started to ask Cameli for help.

“That's why I figured it was time to create a website. The number one term that people searched for was ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Replacement’ and that's why I chose that name. I also own ‘Nissan LEAF battery Installers.’”

Cameli bought the domain on August 17, 2020, and the site went live on August 26, 2020. The idea to make it a global repository came precisely from MUXSAN, which is in the Netherlands.

Ever since InsideEVs wrote about the EV Rides service of replacing Leaf battery packs, we have been receiving requests from other companies all over the world that also perform this sort of service. Cameli came to their rescue, as you can see below.

Speaking about his experience with the car in the video above, Cameli bought his brand new Nissan Leaf SL on April 20, 2013.

“It has 82,000 miles and I have lost 6 bars. I can drive 35 miles now at 40 mph, and around 30 at 60 mph. A couple of months ago, I had to drive to a client who was 157 miles round trip. The total drive took me 11.5 hours because I had to charge five times.”

This is the sort of sacrifice we hope he does not have to do for much longer when he gets a new battery pack for his Nissan. For what he told us, his car is in much need of that.

It is vital to notice Cameli is just listing the companies that perform these services. Their prices and even the quality of their services is beyond his control. That said, make sure these companies have good reputations and ask them about their fees before closing any deal. The more companies available, the better.

You can help Cameli and other used EV cars find these companies close to their homes by informing the map creator of the ones that perform the same services EV Rides and MUXSAN do. Whether you own the place or is just aware of any such businesses, get in touch with him through sal@electricsal.com and tell him about any battery pack replacement company you are aware of.

When Cameli started his website, he had 18 locations. His map now has 29 battery pack replacement businesses, and we suspect this article will help that increase a lot more. That shows the potential aftermarket companies dedicated to keeping electric cars running may become a fantastic business opportunity. We’re glad that we are finally discussing these aftermarket battery packs, but we should discuss them even more. Help save used EVs!

- shares





After having my Pulsar Plus stolen while I was at work one day, there was a N15 shaped hole in my heart. But after a few months a British Racing Green (as I like to call it) SSS showed up on Facebook marketplace. Not knowing how to drive manual yet, I had the seller drive me around the hills. I was happy with what I saw and $1200 bucks later I had a car that my friend drove home for me. The SR20 engine squeezed into that engine bay was an awesome thing. It had decent low-down torque, yet it could rev out to the stars. From memory it was up over 8000rpm. The aftermarket muffler had it sounding pretty neat for a 4-cylinder. A fuel economy of around 8 litres per 100 kilometres was the usual for my suburban mix.

Driving in traffic was a little annoying as first gear was locked out until you were at walking pace, but torque in 2nd gear would get you through. Travelling at 100km/h had the engine at 3000rpm, which was a bit loud for listening to podcasts, but not enough to put you off road trips. This meant you could shift 1-2-5 onto the freeway, using all of 2nd gear to get up to speed. Shifting through the five speeds added to the joy, with a longish throw that added to the fun of rowing into each notchy gear. Having driven a 2nd-Gen Mazda 3 shortly after, I much preferred shifting with my arm than just my wrist.

Me and the boys had some fun trying to find a clutch fluid reservoir on this cable clutch system. The pedal wasn't heavy, but wasn't overly communicative either. I had bought this car with what looked like King Low springs already installed. The ""metro bus seat material"" trimmed sports seats held you in well, as it cornered very flat through the hills. The Pulsar did have the tendency to oversteer at the limit, and felt disinterested in any forms of lift-off fun. The steering wheel was on the smaller side, making the rack feel faster, which felt great.

Cupholders were nowhere to be seen, much like in most cars of this era. The rear seats could fold almost flat when pushed down, or could become level when folding forward the rear seat base into the rear seat footwell - perfect for drive-in cinemas. The mirrors were tiny, but visibility was still excellent when looking over your shoulders. That, coupled with an awesome turning circle, made parallel parking a joy instead of a chore. Speakers in the front doors and rear parcel shelf meant you could pump some decent sound with some cheap speakers and a deck. If you are looking to dip your toes into some club racing, this was another area where this car shines. Once I bought this car, I had raced a few hillclimb events, as it was a car I didn't mind if I crashed. I could always replace it. It did a pretty good job in the ""2000cc and under category"", and was a blast to drive at eleven-tenths.

Unfortunately, immobilizers weren't standard fit on the N15 Pulsars, meaning that if you're only using a club lock at work and the shops (and not just at home), you may end up in a situation like I was, with bags packed and ready for a weekend in Marysville but with no car to put them in. My SSS was never seen again after December 27th, 2019. It was my second N15 stolen. Only an insane person would get a third one. It doesn't stop my friends sending me listings and it hasn't stopped me from toying with the idea. MORE: Nissan Pulsar news and reviews

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: Did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen (US$87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

""I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG""

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Kelly is accused of conspiring to under-report money promised to Ghosn after retirement, an accusation he denies AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win more than 99 per cent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

DEFENCE REMAINS CONFIDENT

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.","<div><p>TOKYO: The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.</p><p>Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p></p><br />     <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.</p><p>And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.</p><p></p><br />            <img class=""picture__image lazyload"" alt=""Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019""><br />            <br />                    <br /><br />Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI<br />            <br />    <p>The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.</p><p></p><br />    <br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing.

Ray Abelada was fortunate enough to get his hands on this KH2 Gunmetal model, and his train of thought on modifying it almost derails the notion that wild, in-your-face mods need to accompany Nissan's classically boxy, muscular '90s hero. Unlike many of you, Ray didn't daydream about blasting around town in Nissan's turbocharged, AWD wonder. His attention was locked into another brand entirely. ""I grew up in the late '90s era and I've always been a Honda guy,"" he states. The idea of importing and tackling this build was a result of his friend, Tony, who'd been talking about building a JDM Integra. ""I started looking for my own JDM project car. I wanted something unique and that could stand out on its own.""

JDM Driver

The unplanned search led to the hunt for a Skyline GTS-T model, and with very few options in his region, he came up short. ""Two months had passed, and I missed out on several purchases. I eventually broadened my search to include GT-Rs and accidentally found Driver Motorsports through a Google image search in January 2017."" Reaching out to Chris Driver to get more info on a GT-R they had on their website, Ray was hit with the bad news as Chris informed him the car had already been spoken for. However, it wasn't all bad—the Premium JDM importer was expecting another GT-R shortly and Ray was eager to get a look.

With a number of photos and info provided by Driver Motorsports on their incoming Skyline, Ray was sold and immediately wired a deposit to make sure he didn't miss the opportunity. Not even a week later, Ray, and his family geared up for a 3-hour drive to bring home their new family weekend car. Starting with a clean chassis is always a good idea and this R32 was in excellent shape. So impressed by the newly acquired skyline's condition and his overall experience with the transaction, Ray's extended family visited Driver Motorsports and picked up a Nissan Gloria and Laurel.

Groomed to Perfection

The only modifications done to the R32 upon Ray taking ownership were M's intake pods and a Kakimoto exhaust system. Like almost any enthusiast, regardless of brand or vehicle type, the first set of changes were based on coilovers and a set of wheels. In actuality, those wound up being the only upgrades for an entire year as he just wanted to enjoy the car as-is. Of course, with so many aftermarket options just a few keystrokes away, it's not hard to justify picking up some new parts, and Ray finally gave in, ordering a custom-spec set of Leon Hardiritt Reise wheels through Phil of RavSpec. A lengthy process being that the rollers would still have to be built and make their way back across the pond, it granted more than enough time to get ahold of some additional goods.

Rather than trying to pack on additional body panel muscle, Ray decided to highlight the coupe's natural angles with an N1 style front lip to fill out the front bumper, then capped it off with an Ab Flug carbon-fiber front diffuser. The combination is seamless and updates the Skyline's front without stepping away from its early '90s charm. A vented Seibon carbon hood finishes off the front end's mild makeover.

To streamline the sides of the GT-R, and match the flow of the front bumper's new, lower appearance, a set of Shorin carbon-fiber side skirts were sourced through RHDJapan and lead your eyes toward the Gracer/Trust rear bumper spats that, in conjunction with the factory rear quarter panel lines, help encapsulate the rear. Other additions include sleek GKTEch side mirrors and atop the trunk you'll spot a factory spoiler that's been topped with a Fujimura carbon gurney flap. To tie everything together, the 19x10 +20 Leon Hardiritt wheels arrived and were wrapped in 255/35s and offer a gunmetal face to match the Skyline's body and a polished lip to offset the look.

As much as we like the outside look of this build, the interior might be one of its best attributes. The dash panels confirm that Driver Motorsports imports some immaculate cars, as the surfaces look picture perfect. Enhancing the look and adding Ray's touch included a set of Recaro Wildcats and matching door panel inserts that play nicely with the red laced Momo wheel and restitched shift and e-brake boots.

More Power on the Horizon

By now you've grown accustomed to seeing 700-plus hp Skylines with huge single turbo conversions and so have we, but in Ray's case, he's eased himself into the power production part of the build. The factory turbos were rebuilt using steel blades and a Mine's equal-length downpipe was bolted on in addition to a set of Tomei dump tubes with the brand's titanium test pipe and exhaust. More fuel is provided by FIC 750s and a Walbro pump and in the hands of Driver Motorsports, the Haltech Platinum Pro brings power up to 373hp safely and reliably.

Those numbers certainly aren't here to stay, and Ray fully expects to outgrow that power output as a pair of GT2860s at home can attest. He notes, ""I didn't want to run them on the stock bottom end and oil pump. I figure the safest way is to pull the motor and upgrade to forged internals, then install the GT2860's and get it retuned.""","<div><p class=""article-text"">Cars like this 1990 R32 <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/"">Nissan</a> Skyline GT-R don't come along very often. Sure, we're all well-aware of the 25-year rule and the decent amount of R32s that have trickled into the U.S. as a result, but even to that point, there aren't a ton of them roaming your local streets. On occasion you might spot one in the wild, but you probably get your fix by catching them on the Super Street Network or during a social media scroll-fest, and more often than not they're heavily modded, boasting huge power and enlarged shoulders and hind quarters. Every once in a while, though, we get a glimpse of a more street-friendly example that isn't quite so extreme.</p><br /><br /><a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1990-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Ab-Flug-Front-Diffuser-01.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1990 Nissan Skyline GT R Ab Flug Front Diffuser 01"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1990 Nissan Skyline GT R Ab Flug Front Diffuser 01""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1990-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Ab-Flug-Front-Diffuser-01.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1990 Nissan Skyline GT R Ab Flug Front Diffuser 01""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 20/20</span></a> | Personalizing An Iconic 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (20) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text"">Ray Abelada was fortunate enough to get his hands on this KH2 Gunmetal model, and his train of thought on modifying it almost derails the notion that wild, in-your-face mods need to accompany Nissan's classically boxy, muscular '90s hero.

It’s been with us for six months, covered many thousands of miles and been driven by half the team. When it arrived, we were tasked with answering a tricky question: could it reclaim its crown? Tricky.

I remember attending the launch of the original Juke – it was a revolutionary concept and created a completely new sector of the motoring market. Since then, though, many other car manufacturers have caught on to the baby crossover concept and the segment has become crowded with alternatives to the car that started it all.

So, where the Juke was sitting pretty on the top of the pile back in the day, we wanted to see if – with so much choice now – the Nissan has slipped down the pecking order.

Our Puma vs Captur vs Juke group test placed the Juke third out of, um, three. Which rather suggests that Nissan has a bit to do to catch up with its nearest rivals. However, I have been accosted many times by potential new Juke buyers in supermarket car parks. They all already have a Juke and want to upgrade to the newer model – none of them especially wants to go to another carmaker. So, to those people, I say, you will love it. It’s more spacious than the original and has a much better design.

It’s frugal and easy to manoeuvre. But, as to whether it can reclaim its crown… well, the answer to that is likely, no. Not because the Juke isn’t a good car, but simply because it has to fight on so many fronts. It’s been reliable, economical, spacious enough… OK, some don’t like its style, but at least it stands out from the crowd.

This little crossover managed a long and arduous M1/M25/London commute just as well as it nipped through country lanes. So, through it may not have reclaimed its crown, to me it’s still royally good.","<div><p>That&#8217;s all folks. Time for the Juke to leave us for pastures new.

This video offers a deep dive into the car's history from someone who knows it inside and out. Craig Lieberman was a technical advisor for the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, and helped introduce Walker to the GT-R.

An R32 GT-R at a ""Fast and Furious"" car casting call piqued Walker's interest, Lieberman said, so he took the actor to MotoRex, a company that was importing and federalizing GT-Rs at the time (this was before the model was officially launched in the United States with the R35 generation). MotoRex then loaned Walker an R34—nicknamed ""Blackbird""—for an extended test drive.

After the test drive, Walker purchased the car featured in this video. It's a 1999 V-Spec model painted in Sonic Silver. V-Spec models got a few performance upgrades over the base GT-R, including an active limited-slip differential and stiffer suspension. However, it was soon surpassed by the V-Spec II, and later by the even more hardcore M-Spec and Nismo Z-Tune models.

Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec

Walker later traded the silver V-Spec for a white V-Spec II, according to Lieberman. The silver car was sold to an owner in Hawaii. Intending to make the car into a replica of the MotoRex Blackbird (while retaining the silver color), he installed a C-West bodykit, as well as a carbon-fiber hood and some other performance parts.

The car was later seized from its Hawaiian owner by the DEA as part of an asset-forfeiture ruling, and sold at auction. It went to an owner in Texas, who kept it for about 15 years, Lieberman said. It was sold earlier this year to JDM importer Toprank. The R34 is one of only 14 federalized Skyline GT-Rs imported by MotoRex (other R34 Skylines won't be legal to import until 2024 under the 25-year-rule), according to Lieberman. That, along with the connection to Paul Walker, means this car is likely worth about $400,000, he said.

It's also worth noting that this car is not the R34 GT-R Walker drove in ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" They aren't even the same shade of silver (the movie car was painted in a non-factory hue from U.S. firm House of Kolor). That was actually Lieberman's own personal car.

the 500,000th Nissan Leaf and owner Maria JansenNissan originally targeted the production of 500,000 EVs by 2012, including the Leaf and other cars using its companion AESC battery technology.",15/09/2020,"Nearly a decade after the model was launched, Nissan has reported that it's produced more than 500,000 Leaf electric cars.

The milestone Leaf was produced at the automaker's Sunderland, England, factory in August, but Nissan held off on announcing it until Wednesday to coincide with World EV Day.

The car will go to an owner in Norway—Maria Jansen.

""My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it,"" Jansen said in a statement. ""We're very excited to become the proud owners of the 500,000th Nissan Leaf. This car really meets our needs with extended range and enhanced technologies.""

Nissan launched the first-generation Leaf in December 2010, making it the first mass-market all-electric car to go on sale. The current, second-generation, Leaf was introduced for the 2018 model year.

While 500,000 electric cars is a noteworthy achievement, it's taken Nissan much longer to reach that goal than originally expected. And it's not the first EV to get there; the Tesla Model 3 passed that mark earlier this year.

the 500,000th Nissan Leaf and owner Maria Jansen

Nissan originally targeted the production of 500,000 EVs by 2012, including the Leaf and other cars using its companion AESC battery technology. Including sales in China, it would have been even more.

Other electric models have been slow to materialize. Nissan sells the e-NV200 electric van in certain markets, and plans to launch the Ariya crossover as a 2022 model. An EV for Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand is expected as well.

It's been less than a year and a half since the Leaf crossed 400,000 sales, though, and that's a testament to the model's extensive refresh for 2018. Sales have picked up in some of the Leaf's global markets—like Europe, where it was the top-selling EV for the 2018 calendar year.

But in the United States and elsewhere, the Tesla Model 3 has taken the lead in EV sales most months.

Meanwhile, Nissan's production in Smyrna has made Tennessee one of the hotbeds for EV production in the U.S. Volkswagen is now planning to bring ID.4 production to its Chattanooga factory in 2022.

Let's not forget the name—Leaf has a powerful meaning referring to how in choosing an EV we're choosing cleaner air. Sales figures aside, let's not lose sight of it and the change it's brought about.","<div><p>Nearly a decade after the model was launched, Nissan has reported that it's produced more than 500,000 Leaf electric cars.</p><br /><p>The milestone Leaf was produced at the automaker's Sunderland, England, factory in August, but Nissan held off on announcing it until Wednesday to coincide with World EV Day.</p><p class=""nativo-article-slot""></p><br /><p>The car will go to an owner in Norway&#8212;Maria Jansen.</p><br /><p>""My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it,"" Jansen said in a statement.

Some of us instead have to wait for depreciation to take its toll, and that’s where early examples of the second-generation Nissan Leaf come in.

Here’s a car that provides all of the practicality of a family hatchback and plenty of modern safety technology, and since the Leaf remains one of the most popular EVs, there are loads of second-hand examples for sale.

You can find a well-specified, mid-range 2018 Leaf for £20,000 or so – a substantial saving of around £7000 compared with the list price of a new one.

There are two motor/battery combinations: the standard Leaf uses a 40kWh pack and a 148bhp motor, while the pricier Leaf e+ gets a 62kWh pack and a 214bhp motor.

The regular model has a 0-60mph time of around 8.0sec, making it much nippier than conventionally powered rivals. And in the Leaf e+, you actually need to be a bit gentle with your right foot when accelerating out of junctions, otherwise you’ll spin its front wheels.

There’s a choice of trims, but entry-level Visia is best avoided – unless you’re a fan of hair shirts. In fact, that model was dropped shortly after launch, because most buyers went for the next step up, Acenta, to get 16in alloy wheels, blindspot monitoring, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, a reversing camera and a 7.0in touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

Arrive at a corner and the Leaf remains fluent, thanks to little body lean and well-weighted steering. Grip is good too, and while the handling won’t inspire you, it’s reassuringly safe and secure. The ride comfort is generally very good as well, with only larger bumps catching out the Leaf.

Continua a mietere successi e record, la Nissan Leaf. L’auto full electric del produttore giapponese, capace di aggiudicarsi diversi premi e riconoscimenti in tutto il mondo (come lo “European Car of the Year” e il “World Car of the Year” nel 2011 e il “Car of the Year Japan” nel 2011-2012) taglia un traguardo storico per il mondo della mobilità alternativa.

La Leaf ha infatti raggiunto e superato il traguardo dei 500 mila modelli prodotti e consegnati a clienti in tutto il mondo, dimostrando così che il progetto nato e sviluppato 10 anni fa nel Paese del Sol Levante era destinato al successo. La vettura numero mezzo milione è stata assemblata nel sito produttivo di Sunderland, nel cuore del Regno Unito, dove la casa costruttrice giapponese ha realizzato circa 175 mila modelli della Nissan Leaf. Di questi, 5.700 circolano quotidianamente in Italia. Nel nostro Paese, poi, è possibile acquistare anche la versione Nissan Leaf e+, che garantisce una maggiore autonomia grazie alla batteria potenziata.

A ricevere il veicolo è stata un’ignara coppia di coniugi norvegesi. “Mio marito ed io abbiamo scelto di acquistare Nissan LEAF nel 2018 – ha commentato Maria Jansen, proprietari della Leaf numero 500 mila – ed è stato amore a prima vista. Siamo molto fieri di avere la 500 millesima Leaf prodotta perché grazie alla maggiore autonomia e alle tecnologie avanzate, soddisfa pienamente le nostre esigenze”.

Nonostante i due coniugi abbiano deciso di acquistare la loro auto elettrica nel 2018, la consegna è avvenuta solo qualche tempo dopo. In una data, però, tutt’altro che casuale: la Nissan Leaf numero 500 mila è arrivata a casa della coppia norvegese lo scorso 9 settembre, data nella quale si celebra il World EV Day, ossia la giornata mondiale dedicata ai veicoli a trazione completamente elettrica (l’acronimo “EV”, per i pochi che non lo sapessero, sta proprio per “Electric Vehicle”).

Diverse le tecnologie che, in questi 10 anni, hanno contribuito al successo dell’auto elettrica giapponese. Il sistema e-Pedal, ad esempio, permette di guidare con il solo pedale dell’acceleratore e migliorare in maniera sensibile le prestazioni del sistema di recupero dell’energia in frenata. Il ProPILOT, invece, unisce diversi sistemi di assistenza alla guida che assistono il conducente in fase di sterzata, accelerazione e frenata.

Infine, il produttore del Paese del Sol Levante sta implementando anche in Italia la rete proprietaria di colonnine Fast Charge, che consentono di ricaricare in fretta la batteria della Leaf. Facendo il “pieno” in una delle stazioni di ricarica Nissan, è possibile ricaricare la batteria dal 20% al 60% in appena un’ora.","<div><p class=""hatom-extra""><br />editato in:  <br />da  <br /></p><p>Continua a mietere successi e record, la <strong>Nissan Leaf</strong>.

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault will develop and assemble the next generation of partner Nissan’s Micra models, a senior executive at the Japanese firm said, as the two companies try to reboot their alliance with tighter cooperation in production.

Ashwani Gupta, Nissan’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with France’s Le Monde newspaper published on Monday that the Micra plan was an example of their “leader-follower” strategy, with one firm taking the lead on certain car types.

Nissan Micra models are already assembled at Renault’s Flins factory in France, although that site is set to be turned over to recycling activities around 2024, when the life cycle of the car ranges made there expires.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

Both struggling financially, Renault and Nissan have cleared the decks of old managers and outlined joint cost-saving plans as they try to move on from a scandal surrounding former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn.

A prototype version of the new Nissan Z will debut September 15.

The new Nissan Z's design will take inspiration from its predecessors, if this new teaser video is any indication. It draws a clear line between the original 240Z and the new model's headlight shape, while also showing the taillights that are clearly a nod to the legendary 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Nissan

We can also see the silhouette of the Z, which Nissan has teased before, and the car's new badge that's on the rear flank of the car. It appears to have a similar shape as the current model, but the details should make it look far more modern than the 370Z, which arrived way back in 2009.



We expect the new Z to be called 400Z and be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine. It'll retain the classic front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and will hopefully come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. (If it doesn't, we'll be disappointed.) The so-called ""Z Proto"" that debuts September 15 will likely be similar to the eventual production model that should arrive later this year before going on sale sometime in 2021.

Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.

Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.

In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""

The spokesman said other models would continue to meet the needs of local consumers.

Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.

The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.

Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.

The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.

Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.

The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres. The X-Trail is a sport utility vehicle with a minimal 2.0-litre engine. The Sylphy is a compact car with a 1.6-litre engine.

Upon learning of the reported discontinuation, a Nissan Teana owner who asked not to be named said his family has three Nissan cars, two of which are Teanas. They have proved to be comfortable vehicles, but the family has become worried about resale prices.

Pisit Rangsaritwutikul, president of the Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) under the Industry Ministry, said a change in production lines among car makers during the economic recession caused by the pandemic's impact is normal. They need to adjust themselves to markets in each country.

""I'm not shocked by the news reports,"" Mr Pisit said. ""The parent company will have already carefully considered what car models will be produced to satisfy motorists in different countries.""

Mr Pisit said the Thai market has potential for electric vehicles and companies probably see an opportunity for new business directions.

Nissan's decision reflects its plan to adjust car manufacturing in Thailand by moving towards new-generation cars, following a talk with officials at the Industry Ministry.

Nissan is ""confident"" in Thailand, where it plans to continue its business, Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said in an earlier interview after a recent talk with Ramesh Narasimhan, the president of Nissan Motor Thailand.

Nissan is determined to produce both electric and hybrid cars in the long term and has already won support from the Board of Investment through its incentive programmes, Mr Suriya said.

The company's Yokohama-based headquarters announced in May that Nissan's Indonesian plant would be closed as part of a four-year plan to improve business performance.

The closure would make Thailand Nissan's sole production base in Southeast Asia.","<div><p class=""article-headline""><br /><h2><br />Nissan mum on discontinuation report</h2><br /></p><br /><img src=""https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2020/09/09/3743419.jpg"" alt=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)"" title=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)""><br /><br /><br />Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)<br /><br /><p>Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.</p><p>Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.</p>&#13;<br /><p>In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""</p>&#13;<br /><p>The spokesman said other models would&#160;continue to meet the needs of local consumers.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres.

60,60,60,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Nissan-s-record-loan-guarantee-spotlights-lack-of-transparency,Nissan's record loan guarantee spotlights lack of transparency,"TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record 130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.
Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic.
The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.
The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.
The JFC's loan guarantees, which will be covered by taxpayer funds if the loans go sour, are the last line of defense in terms of corporate support.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record 130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.

The Development Bank of Japan extended over 1.88 trillion yen in crisis response loans between March and July as the virus damaged the national and global economy. Nissan is the only major corporation covered by guarantees from the state-backed Japan Finance Corp.

But other large companies could receive bailouts similar to Nissan's if the coronavirus crisis persists. Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic. Japan's three megabanks granted 1.2 trillion yen in financing to Toyota Motor alone.

""We've accepted almost all loan requests from the first wave of applications, but second helpings [of additional financing] will be tough,"" said an executive at a megabank. Considering demand is not expected to recover amid the pandemic, the extra financing risks becoming toxic debt.

Banks already were limited in how much they can loan to each company or group based on the need to keep their financial institution sound. The Financial Stability Board, an international body made up of financial watchdogs, reportedly has shifted from encouraging loans that keep companies afloat to debating how to maintain the health of banking institutions.

If private lenders approach their limits, then public-sector institutions like the Development Bank of Japan will start filling the gap.

The DBJ approves a crisis response loan if it deems the company to have a sufficiently large impact on livelihoods and Japan's economy. Job creation and a wide base of subcontractors are two factors in the approval process. Normally, the DBJ assumes the risk if the debt cannot be recovered.

The bank decided to lend Nissan a total of 180 billion yen in May. Japan was under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Automobile production was at a virtual standstill, and vehicle purchases had plummeted.

Nissan employs 140,000 people groupwide, and the blow would be even larger if subcontractors are counted. The DBJ also apparently considered that private-sector banks' efforts to provide assistance would be harmed if Nissan did not receive financial support.

The loan to Nissan is funded through the Japan Finance Corp. The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.

A JFC loan guarantee is not unusual under the crisis response system. Individual recipients of the guarantees are not expected to be disclosed since that could affect the company's credit rating. The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.

A Nissan spokesman says the automaker is ""completely unaware"" of the government guarantee.

In addition to the program's lack of transparency, there is the issue of ensuring managerial discipline of companies receiving such guarantees. In 2010, Japan Airlines received 350 billion yen in public funds, along with government-guaranteed financing. At the time, the distressed carrier faced withering scrutiny over its business practices. Nissan's situation has not deteriorated to that extent.

The JFC's loan guarantees, which will be covered by taxpayer funds if the loans go sour, are the last line of defense in terms of corporate support.","<div><p>TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record&#160;130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores&#160;a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.</p><p>The Development Bank of Japan extended over&#160;1.88 trillion yen in crisis response loans between March and July as the virus damaged the national and global economy.

The Financial Stability Board, an international body made up of financial watchdogs, reportedly has shifted from encouraging loans that&#160;keep companies&#160;afloat to debating how to maintain the health of banking institutions.</p><p>If private lenders approach their limits, then public-sector institutions like the Development Bank of Japan will start filling the gap.</p><p>The DBJ approves a crisis response loan if it deems the company to have a sufficiently large impact on livelihoods and Japan's&#160;economy.&#160;Job creation and a wide&#160;base of subcontractors&#160;are two factors in&#160;the approval process. Normally, the DBJ assumes the risk if the debt cannot be recovered.</p><p>The bank decided to lend Nissan a total of 180 billion yen in May. Japan was under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Automobile production was at a virtual standstill, and vehicle purchases had plummeted.</p><p>Nissan employs 140,000 people groupwide, and the blow would be even larger if subcontractors are counted. The DBJ also apparently considered that private-sector banks' efforts to provide assistance&#160;would be harmed if Nissan did not receive financial support.</p><p>The loan to Nissan is funded through&#160;the Japan Finance Corp.&#160;The government is providing&#160;guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.</p><p>A JFC loan guarantee is not unusual under the crisis response system. Individual recipients of the guarantees are not expected to be disclosed since that&#160;could affect the company's credit rating. The Finance Ministry website&#160;lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.</p><p>A Nissan spokesman says the automaker is ""completely unaware"" of the government guarantee.</p><p>In addition to the&#160;program's lack of transparency, there is the issue of ensuring managerial discipline of companies receiving such&#160;guarantees. In 2010, Japan Airlines received 350 billion yen in public funds, along with government-guaranteed financing. At the time, the distressed carrier faced withering scrutiny over its business practices. Nissan's situation has not deteriorated to that extent.</p><p>The JFC's loan guarantees, which will be covered by taxpayer funds if the loans go sour, are the last line of defense in terms of corporate support.</p><p id=""AdAsia""></p><p class=""o-ads article__advert article__advert--center""></p></div>",0.076,0.10400000000000001,-0.9536,9Ng9nP7adMJeEV6jTtrsUM,,

Dubbed the 'Proto Z', we already know that it's going to take styling inspiration from the older Fairladies such as the 240Z and the 300ZX, but feature modern tech that makes it competitive with Toyota's revived Supra.

A few more details are revealed in the short clip, such as the 'Z' emblems on the door sills, wide alloy wheels, and a pair of LED headlights.

When it comes to the engine, it's no surprise to hear that familiar V6 tone, except this one will come with a pair of turbochargers. Reports state that Nissan is using a 3.0-litre Infiniti engine that is shared with the Q50 and Q60 Red Sport.

Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity.
""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney.
Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.
But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.",13/09/2020,"TOKYO — Nissan's indicted former boss Carlos Ghosn has fled, but the American lieutenant he left behind in Japan — Greg Kelly, accused of being his accomplice — finally heads to court in Tokyo this week in a closely watched case that will bring some measure of closure to the corporate saga.

Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest.

Kelly was released on bail that Christmas but has been required to live in Japan, where he and his lawyers have been plowing through mountains of evidence to prepare for their defense.

Kelly, a human resources manager who climbed Nissan's global executive ladder from its operations in Tennessee, is charged with orchestrating a plan to conceal more than $80 million in deferred remuneration to Ghosn over the 2010-17 fiscal years, resulting in the information not being reported in Nissan's public financial documents.

Ghosn was arrested separately the same day as Kelly in a coordinated sweep by Japanese prosecutors. But Ghosn jumped bail at the end of December 2019 and fled to Lebanon.

If found guilty, Kelly could face up to a decade of prison in Japan.

His trial will be long. It is expected to run through July, with a verdict no earlier than fall 2021.

Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity. While Nissan is expected to not contest the charges, Kelly and Ghosn maintain their innocence.

Kelly rose from his job as Nissan's top U.S. human resources executive in Nashville to become an executive vice president with the Renault-Nissan Alliance and eventually a director on Nissan's board in Japan.

He has said that Nissan money earmarked for Ghosn was not part of a scheme to provide deferred compensation. On the contrary, it was a legal draft of a post-retirement contract intended to keep Ghosn as an adviser to the Japanese carmaker and prevent him from bolting to a competitor. Kelly maintains that the amount of the compensation was never fixed, the contracts were never signed, and nothing was ever paid.

""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney. ""The statute is laughably obtuse and vague. He is clearly innocent.""

The case is drawing international support for the former Nissan director, who spent the last few years of his career working in Japan for the automaker.

Three U.S. senators published a letter in support of Kelly this year. Sens. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee called Kelly's predicament a ""cautionary tale"" for Americans working in Japan.

As he awaited trial on bail, he was prevented from leaving Japan and has been living in a Tokyo apartment, where he has been joined by his wife from Nashville. In order to stay in Japan, his wife studies Japanese language on a student visa and must maintain high standing or run the risk of losing legal immigration status.

Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.

Ghosn was once pinned as a friendly witness backing Kelly's defense, until he bolted Japan. But Kelly holds no animosity toward his former boss for leaving him to go it alone, Wareham said.

Among the challenges faced by Kelly's legal team are digging through a mountain of evidence and lacking access to dozens more boxes of documents that his attorneys said were being withheld.

The first installment of evidence from prosecutors was an 11-terabyte data dump — equivalent to 1 billion documents.

Since then, prosecutors say they have produced another 84 boxes of materials. But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.

Language will be another challenge.

Las Cruces Sun-News

LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of creating a fictitious identity and using it to fraudulently purchase a brand-new vehicle — and nearly a second one before his arrest.

Richard Padilla, 32, who claimed an address of 999 W. Amador Ave., is charged with one second-degree felony count of fraud more than $20,000, two third-degree felony counts of attempted fraud of more than $20,000, two fourth-degree felony counts of forgery, a fourth-degree felony count of identity theft and a fourth-degree felony count of possession of methamphetamine.

Investigators believe Padilla either stole or obtained stolen mail and used information in it — including a paper driver’s license and a Social Security number — to create a fictitious identification. Investigators learned he used the photo from his driver’s license and copied it to the paper driver’s license that was stolen, creating a realistic-looking paper, or temporary, driver’s license.

Investigators learned Padilla used the fictious paperwork on Sept. 8 to purchase a 2020 Nissan Titan from a local dealership. The Nissan was valued at approximately $60,000. Padilla was trying to purchase a 2020 Ford F-150, valued at approximately $40,000, from another local dealership when he was detained for questioning by Las Cruces police.

Investigators learned Padilla also forged information to create a fake insurance document that was needed to complete the vehicle purchase. Padilla is also suspected of using the fake ID to cash checks.

Police encourage automobile dealerships — and other businesses that require identification cards to facilitate a transaction — to use caution when accepting a paper or temporary driver’s license. Police suggest taking all the necessary precautions in learning the true identity of the consumer before completing a transaction.

Similar cases of fraud and identity theft have been reported in Las Cruces within the last few months. Police are still investigating those cases.

Padilla was arrested Friday, Sept. 11, and booked into the Doña Ana County Detention Center where he is initially being held without bond.","<div><p class=""gnt_ar_by"">From Staff Reports</p><p class=""gnt_ar_pb"">Las Cruces Sun-News</p><img class=""gnt_em_img_i"" src=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/09/11/PNM2/e284d01c-765e-4de1-be24-55ca430737a8-Richard_Padilla_Arrest_mug_Aug_11_2020.jpg?width=300&amp;height=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp"" alt=""Richard Padilla""><p class=""gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd""></p><p class=""gnt_ar_b_p"">LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of creating a fictitious identity and using it to fraudulently purchase a brand-new vehicle &#8212; and nearly a second one before his arrest.</p><p class=""gnt_ar_b_p"">Richard Padilla, 32, who claimed an address of 999 W.

Reveal set for September 16

The ageing Nissan 370Z sports car will soon be replaced by an all-new model, likely called the 400Z. Nissan will reveal a concept for the new car (called the Z Proto) on September 16th and has released numerous teasers giving you an idea of what to expect from its new Toyota Supra rival.

Many of these hints have come in the form of a promotional video, embedded above. While they are quite indistinct, they do show the car will feature similar proportions to Z-cars of the past, including the 240z, 300ZX, 350Z and 370Z.

The Z Proto’s headlights will take inspiration from the classic 240Z.

As such, you can expect it to come with a long bonnet, heavily raked windscreen, two-door design and circular daytime-running lights that mimic the round headlights fitted to the classic 240Z sportscar from the 1970s.

This sketch has echos of the ’90s 300ZX sports car.

An official drawing of the new car’s rear end shared on Instagram by Nissan’s Vice-President of global design appears to show a strong design influence from the 300ZX sports car of the early 1990s.

A tweet from Nissan’s Australian division gives you a chance to hear the new car’s engine for the first time. The Z Proto and 400Z are expected to come with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine and the smooth, yet slightly muted, revs of the car in the video supports this. Adding turbochargers means Nissan can downsize the new car’s engine without sacrificing any power. Expect the new Z to come with a 3.0-litre engine producing more power than the outgoing Nissan 370Z’s 328hp 3.7-litre unit.

This image confirms the new Z will come with a manual gearbox.

Like the outgoing Nissan 370Z, and the 350Z before that, the new 400Z will come with a manual gearbox – something of a rarity these days. However, you’ll almost certainly be able to pay extra to get an automatic gearbox if you’d prefer.

You’ll probably have to wait until 2023 to get your hands on the new Z.

Nissan 400Z price and release date

When it goes on sale either in 2022 or early in 2023, the new Z will give Nissan a direct rival for the popular Toyota Supra, reigniting a battle first seen in the 1980s and 1990s. Nissan will reveal the full Z Proto concept online at 01:30 am on September 16. The new Z will likely cost more than the £30,000 outgoing car, partly as a result of having a twin-turbo, rather than naturally aspirated, engine.

The newspaper cites two sources who claim production was originally set to begin in October, although that date has not been confirmed by the Japanese car maker.

In a statement sent to Autocar, Nissan said: ""Preparations continue for the launch of the new Qashqai in Sunderland, which represents a £400m investment in the plant.""

The firm added: ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

The FT indicated that the apparent delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed development and changed the firm's priorities. It suggested the delay could also allow Nissan to work out its course of action should Britain not secure a deal with the European Union post-Brexit.

Just over half of the approximately 500,000 cars produced at Sunderland annually are exported to Europe, and two-thirds of those are Qashqais. Any trade tariffs with the EU would ""jeopardise"" Sunderland's business model, bosses have previously claimed.

The report suggests that production of the new Qashqai will not begin until after April 2021. The current version has been on sale since 2014.

After stopping during the first safety car period without changing drivers, Fujinami was able to take advantage of clear air and gain ground before handing over to de Oliveira for the run to the flag, the Brazilian moving up from 12th to sixth at the finish.

However, Kondo was later stripped of the points it scored due to a 30-second penalty for an infraction at its first pitstop, applied for having the engine running before the car had been lowered from its jacks, dropping de Oliveira and Fujinami to 20th place.

De Oliveira said the rules breach was brought to the attention of the stewards by fellow Nissan GT300 team Gainer, whose #11 car moved up to sixth place as a result of Kondo's penalty and leads the points standings.

The long-time Nissan GT500 driver described the situation as ""annoying"" and ""sad"", and vowed not to help Gainer in its championship fight as a result.

""It was a good race, so it was a bit of a shock to hear afterwards that another Nissan team had made a claim,"" de Oliveira told Motorsport.com.

""It’s pretty annoying and quite sad that we get that reaction from a [fellow] Nissan team. They might need our help at the end of the season. They won’t have it. I hope we’re in a position to take it away from them.

De Oliveira and Fujinami went into the Motegi weekend sixth in the GT300 points standings, but with their non-score have slipped to seventh, 24 points down on Gainer's championship-leading duo Katsuyuki Hiranaka and Hironobu Yasuda.

The Kondo duo qualified towards the back at Motegi after using wet tyres instead of slicks in their Q1 qualifying group on a drying track, unlike the majority of their rivals.","<div><p>De Oliveira and teammate Kiyoto Fujinami had recovered from qualifying down in 28th place in mixed conditions with a strong drive to sixth in the GT300 class, employing an unorthodox two-stop strategy in their #56 Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>After stopping during the first safety car period without changing drivers, Fujinami was able to take advantage of clear air and gain ground before handing over to de Oliveira for the run to the flag, the Brazilian moving up from 12th to sixth at the finish.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>However, Kondo was later stripped of the points it scored due to a 30-second penalty for an infraction at its first pitstop, applied for having the engine running before the car had been lowered from its jacks, dropping de Oliveira and Fujinami to 20th place.</p> <p>De Oliveira said the rules breach was brought to the attention of the stewards by fellow Nissan GT300 team Gainer, whose #11 car moved up to sixth place as a result of Kondo's penalty and leads the points standings.</p> <p>The long-time Nissan GT500 driver described the situation as ""annoying"" and ""sad"", and vowed not to help Gainer in its championship fight as a result.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>""It was a good race, so it was a bit of a shock to hear afterwards that another Nissan team had made a claim,"" de Oliveira told Motorsport.com.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>""It&#8217;s pretty annoying and quite sad that we get that reaction from a [fellow] Nissan team.

Fuel Economy: 8/10AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving.

It’s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class.",08/09/2020,"Small crossovers have been getting better and better these days, with their fair share of features and creature comforts. While the 2020 Nissan Qashqai has seemingly been outdone by newer competitors, the automaker has done quite a lot to ensure it isn’t left behind.

Power: 7/10

A few crossovers in this class offer impressive power figures, and unfortunately the Qashqai isn’t among them. Under the hood is a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with peak output rated at 141 hp at and 147 lb-ft of torque. This motor is paired to a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which works well in most conditions. The engine doesn’t feel particularly gutsy, as it just buzzes along. Unfortunately, the CVT can’t work any miracles either, and it pegs the revs at max tilt trying its best to eke out as much momentum as possible, but the Qashqai doesn’t speed up in any particular hurry.

There are a few drive modes to help customize the experience on the road, but only one truly stands out: an all-wheel-drive (AWD) lock function. In normal operation, the AWD system in the Qashqai varies the power split between the front and rear wheels, and generally it prefers the ones in the front to improve fuel consumption. However, the AWD lock mode in the Qashqai sets up a locked split ratio, ensuring all four wheels are getting power. This is mainly used at low speeds in rough terrain and will be a handy feature when the snow begins to pile up.

Fuel Economy: 8/10

AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving. This makes the Nissan slightly less efficient than rivals like the Subaru Crosstrek, and slightly more efficient than the Hyundai Kona. It’s not, however, the worst in the segment, with the Jeep Compass rated 1.0 L/100 km more combined.

Driving Feel: 6/10

Firing up the Qashqai and setting off, you don’t get the same eagerness or enthusiasm found in other vehicles in the Nissan range like the smaller Kicks. But the Qashqai doesn’t plod about either. It offers a simple driving experience – one that doesn’t feel engaging, nor is it carefree. Throttle response isn’t extremely energetic, and the light steering feel doesn’t inspire much confidence. While the suspension and ride aren’t too vague, if you push for speed on an on-ramp, you’ll be greeted with a lot of body roll. In these ways the Qashqai pales in comparison to the more responsive and engaging driving dynamics of the Crosstrek and Kona. The Qashqai excels when gently cruising on the highway, as the superb driver assistance features can do the heavy lifting.

Styling: 6/10

Nissan has a mixed design language. Some of the brand’s smaller or more affordable models, like the Kicks and Sentra, have delivered some nice styling without breaking the budget. Their bigger vehicles, like the Murano and Maxima, look elegant and premium. Unfortunately, the Qashqai has a slightly dated design that doesn’t fit in either of these two camps. While the overall design is bland, there are a few details that are worth highlighting, like the wheel design, integrated turn signals in the mirrors, and the LED light signature up front.

Inside, the Qashqai has a clean design but is missing playful details. That is becoming less forgivable, as other vehicles in this class are getting clever touches like contrasting stitched leather in the upholstery. Top trim models can be equipped with different shades of leather, and a bit of a quilted pattern to show off some level of craftsmanship, but it’s a shame to hide it away on the most expensive models.

User Friendliness: 7.5/10

Furthermore, there are a few missteps with the ergonomics and usability inside the Qashqai that are pretty frustrating. For starters, there is a bank of useful buttons hidden below the driver’s side of the dash. The heated steering wheel controls, steering assistance, and drive modes are all difficult to see and reach. Furthermore, while the infotainment system has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, the USB port to connect your phone is located in a space that is too small for modern smartphones.

However, Nissan should get credit for making its driver assistance features easy to use and understand. A bright blue button on the steering wheel enables the ProPILOT Assist function, and a clear and legible display in the gauge cluster shows what functions are working. It even shows what the car detects with its various sensors, like the car ahead, or the lane markings. Whenever it struggles to pick up one of these items, it provides a soft beep, rather than a harsh warning, as a reminder to the driver to stay vigilant.

Features: 7/10

Qashqai buyers can expect the usual suspects in terms of features and technology. Base models come with heated seats and a few safety features including blind-spot monitoring and high-beam assist. All models come with a seven-inch colour infotainment system, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

You’ll find features like dual-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel, as well as a sunroof, on the SV model – the next step up in the trim levels. Beyond the SV is the SL, which adds features like leather upholstery, a 360-degree camera, bigger wheels, and the ProPILOT Assist driver assistance and safety suite. The SL Platinum gets an upgraded Bose sound system, LED lighting, and a memory function for the driver seat.

Unfortunately, there are no ventilated seats, and Nissan doesn’t offer heated rear seats in this vehicle.

Safety: 8/10

When it comes to safety and driver assistance features, the Qashqai over-delivers. I’m so impressed with the ProPILOT Assist functionality and refinement, which is clearly among the best in the industry, let alone the segment. Only the Crosstrek with its EyeSight suite of driver assistance features is as comprehensive as the Qashqai, and I felt that the Nissan implementation of adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping was more measured and trustworthy; the way it communicates how each component is working is also an advantage.

The Qashqai performed well in crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) but doesn’t yet qualify for an award since its crash avoidance features haven’t been tested.

Comfort: 7/10

In terms of ride comfort, the only significant note is that the 19-inch wheels on my SL trim tester were noticeable on rough roads. Otherwise, the ride is comfortable enough for the commute. When it comes to the seats, they’re nothing special, but they get the job done. Other Nissan models, including the new Sentra, feature very nicely sculpted and supportive front seats that the automaker claims are inspired by NASA, but the Qashqai is left behind. It’s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class. As large as they are, the rear seats are a little less comfortable than the front seats, with a seating position and angle that may be awkward for adults.

Fortunately, there is a heated steering wheel, two-stage heated front seats, and dual-zone climate control. While the interior isn’t especially small, a bigger sunroof would help bring more sunlight into the cabin, which is always nice.

Practicality: 8/10

There’s a slight difference in cargo space depending on whether it’s equipped with a sunroof or not. Base models of the Qashqai offer 648 L in the cargo area with the rear seats in place, while folding those rear seats brings the total to around 1,730 L. If you get a higher trim model with the sunroof you’ll find 566 L with the seats up and 1,500 L with them folded. This makes the Qashqai more spacious than the Kona but it’s ever-so-slightly behind the Crosstrek.

With the seats folded, the loading surface is relatively flat. One unique addition to the Qashqai is the available cargo divider, which can help stash items in the cargo area or make a barrier to prevent things from rolling around.

Value: 7/10

The Qashqai has a wide range of trim levels, starting at a reasonable $21,598 for a front-wheel-drive S model with a manual transmission. Getting a CVT in this configuration will bump the price up to $24,298, while adding AWD will increase the price to $26,298. The next step up in the models is the SV trim, which is also available with front-wheel drive for $26,898, or $28,898 for an AWD model. The SL and SL Platinum models come standard with AWD and are priced at $31,948 and $34,098, respectively. These prices don’t include the destination fee and handling, which is $1,950.

Only the top two trim levels come with ProPILOT Assist, which is the Qashqai’s best feature. It’s easy to recommend these models, but spending over $30,000 on a subcompact crossover isn’t an easy call considering slightly larger models can be found around the same price. For example, the top trims of compact crossovers like the Subaru Forester and Nissan Rogue are priced below $40,000.

The Verdict

With so many excellent subcompact crossovers on the market, it isn’t easy for a newly refreshed model like the Qashqai to make its mark. It’s hard to compete with the likes of the Hyundai Kona and Subaru Crosstrek, but this Nissan offering fills in a few of the gaps left by those vehicles. Thanks to its impressive driver assistance features and spacious interior, it manages to stay afloat in this burgeoning segment.

Some of the brand&#8217;s smaller or more affordable models, like the Kicks and <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20191216/2020-nissan-sentra-first-drive-review/"">Sentra</a>, have delivered some nice styling without breaking the budget. Their bigger vehicles, like the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20200602/2020-nissan-murano-platinum-review/"">Murano</a> and <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20181128/nissan-shows-refreshed-2019-maxima-in-la/"">Maxima</a>, look elegant and premium. Unfortunately, the Qashqai has a slightly dated design that doesn&#8217;t fit in either of these two camps. While the overall design is bland, there are a few details that are worth highlighting, like the wheel design, integrated turn signals in the mirrors, and the LED light signature up front.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Inside, the Qashqai has a clean design but is missing playful details. That is becoming less forgivable, as other vehicles in this class are getting clever touches like contrasting stitched leather in the upholstery. Top trim models can be equipped with different shades of leather, and a bit of a quilted pattern to show off some level of craftsmanship, but it&#8217;s a shame to hide it away on the most expensive models.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>User Friendliness: 7.5/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>Furthermore, there are a few missteps with the ergonomics and usability inside the Qashqai that are pretty frustrating. For starters, there is a bank of useful buttons hidden below the driver&#8217;s side of the dash. The heated steering wheel controls, steering assistance, and drive modes are all difficult to see and reach. Furthermore, while the infotainment system has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, the USB port to connect your phone is located in a space that is too small for modern smartphones.</p>&#13;<br /><p>However, Nissan should get credit for making its driver assistance features easy to use and understand. A bright blue button on the steering wheel enables the ProPILOT Assist function, and a clear and legible display in the gauge cluster shows what functions are working. It even shows what the car detects with its various sensors, like the car ahead, or the lane markings. Whenever it struggles to pick up one of these items, it provides a soft beep, rather than a harsh warning, as a reminder to the driver to stay vigilant.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Features: 7/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>Qashqai buyers can expect the usual suspects in terms of features and technology. Base models come with heated seats and a few safety features including blind-spot monitoring and high-beam assist. All models come with a seven-inch colour infotainment system, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>&#13;<br /><p>You&#8217;ll find features like dual-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel, as well as a sunroof, on the SV model &#8211; the next step up in the trim levels. Beyond the SV is the SL, which adds features like leather upholstery, a 360-degree camera, bigger wheels, and the ProPILOT Assist driver assistance and safety suite. The SL Platinum gets an upgraded Bose sound system, LED lighting, and a memory function for the driver seat.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Unfortunately, there are no ventilated seats, and Nissan doesn&#8217;t offer heated rear seats in this vehicle.</p>&#13;<br /><p id=""div-gpt-ad-bb-mobile"" class=""ad"">&#13;<br /> &#13;<br /></p>                 &#13;<br /><h2>Safety: 8/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>When it comes to safety and driver assistance features, the Qashqai over-delivers. I&#8217;m so impressed with the ProPILOT Assist functionality and refinement, which is clearly among the best in the industry, let alone the segment. Only the Crosstrek with its EyeSight suite of driver assistance features is as comprehensive as the Qashqai, and I felt that the Nissan implementation of adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping was more measured and trustworthy; the way it communicates how each component is working is also an advantage.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The Qashqai performed well in crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) but doesn&#8217;t yet qualify for an award since its crash avoidance features haven&#8217;t been tested.</p>&#13;<br /><img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/7/b/5/4/4/57b544d7c3b3afc00246bb8366c217419190c059.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/4/5/6/b/8/9/456b89ef7cd526640af3e4dadd3664b5f5476ae8.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/1/4/0/6/f/51406f83665612454a19961ba355d7b203e0df06.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/4/b/e/a/0/5/4bea05ee2aee70b8be18c1f8a8277c769fe82c9a.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/7/b/5/4/4/57b544d7c3b3afc00246bb8366c217419190c059.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/4/5/6/b/8/9/456b89ef7cd526640af3e4dadd3664b5f5476ae8.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/1/4/0/6/f/51406f83665612454a19961ba355d7b203e0df06.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/4/b/e/a/0/5/4bea05ee2aee70b8be18c1f8a8277c769fe82c9a.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <p></p>&#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br /> &#13;<br /><h2>Comfort: 7/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>In terms of ride comfort, the only significant note is that the 19-inch wheels on my SL trim tester were noticeable on rough roads. Otherwise, the ride is comfortable enough for the commute. When it comes to the seats, they&#8217;re nothing special, but they get the job done. Other Nissan models, including the new Sentra, feature very nicely sculpted and supportive front seats that the automaker claims are inspired by NASA, but the Qashqai is left behind. It&#8217;s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class. As large as they are, the rear seats are a little less comfortable than the front seats, with a seating position and angle that may be awkward for adults.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Fortunately, there is a heated steering wheel, two-stage heated front seats, and dual-zone climate control. While the interior isn&#8217;t especially small, a bigger sunroof would help bring more sunlight into the cabin, which is always nice.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Practicality: 8/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>There&#8217;s a slight difference in cargo space depending on whether it&#8217;s equipped with a sunroof or not. Base models of the Qashqai offer 648 L in the cargo area with the rear seats in place, while folding those rear seats brings the total to around 1,730 L. If you get a higher trim model with the sunroof you&#8217;ll find 566 L with the seats up and 1,500 L with them folded. This makes the Qashqai more spacious than the Kona but it&#8217;s ever-so-slightly behind the Crosstrek.</p>&#13;<br /><p>With the seats folded, the loading surface is relatively flat. One unique addition to the Qashqai is the available cargo divider, which can help stash items in the cargo area or make a barrier to prevent things from rolling around.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Value: 7/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>The Qashqai has a wide range of trim levels, starting at a reasonable $21,598 for a front-wheel-drive S model with a manual transmission. Getting a CVT in this configuration will bump the price up to $24,298, while adding AWD will increase the price to $26,298. The next step up in the models is the SV trim, which is also available with front-wheel drive for $26,898, or $28,898 for an AWD model. The SL and SL Platinum models come standard with AWD and are priced at $31,948 and $34,098, respectively. These prices don&#8217;t include the destination fee and handling, which is $1,950.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Only the top two trim levels come with ProPILOT Assist, which is the Qashqai&#8217;s best feature. It&#8217;s easy to recommend these models, but spending over $30,000 on a subcompact crossover isn&#8217;t an easy call considering slightly larger models can be found around the same price. For example, the top trims of compact crossovers like the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20200612/2020-subaru-forester-review/"">Subaru Forester</a> and <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20200722/5-ways-the-2021-nissan-rogue-is-more-family-friendly-than-before/"">Nissan Rogue</a> are priced below $40,000.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>The Verdict</h2>&#13;<br /><p>With so many excellent subcompact crossovers on the market, it isn&#8217;t easy for a newly refreshed model like the Qashqai to make its mark. It&#8217;s hard to compete with the likes of the Hyundai Kona and Subaru Crosstrek, but this Nissan offering fills in a few of the gaps left by those vehicles. Thanks to its impressive driver assistance features and spacious interior, it manages to stay afloat in this burgeoning segment.</p>&#13;<br /> &#13;<br />&#13;<br />                                &#13;<br /> &#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br />    &#13;<br /><p>Holding its own</p>&#13;<br />            <p>9/8/2020 6:30:00 AM</p>&#13;<br />            <p>9/8/2020 6:30:00 AM</p>&#13;<br />        </div>",0.185,0.042,0.9998,bjJHnvRRa3FhcMwpotHzvb,,

According to Japan's Best Car Web, Nissan is still a few years away from launching a redesigned GT-R, the R36 generation (the current generation is the R35), and before it arrives we'll see a special final version of the current car boasting an output of 710 horsepower from the familiar 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V-6.

That's the same output of the special GT-R50 by Italdesign that was unveiled in 2018 to mark the 50th anniversary of the GT-R nameplate. Deliveries started in early 2020 and just 50 are destined to be built.

Nissan GT-R50 by Italdesign

The special final edition model will be even rarer. Only 20 will reportedly be built and if you want one, you'd better be prepared to pay at least 40 million yen (approximately $378,530). The 2021 Nissan GT-R tops out at $212,435 for the Nismo model while the GT-R50 by Italdesign cost a cool $1.1 million.

When might we see the final edition model? It will reportedly land in 2022, which means it will likely arrive as a 2023 model if sold in the United States.

As for the R36 GT-R, Nissan remains quiet on its plans. The last we heard, the automaker was tossing up whether to go the hybrid or battery-electric route for the car.","<div><p>Nissan is close to launching a <a href=""https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1112499_nissan-to-preview-new-z-sports-car-sept-15-with-prototype"">successor to its aging 370Z sports car</a>, but the automaker's other sports car, the GT-R, is just as just as old and equally in need of renewal.

Six days before the car is revealed, the latest clip shows a manual lever displaying an H-pattern gearbox layout with six speeds, to the background noise of what’s almost certainly a turbocharged V6 engine being revved. Good news all round, we’d say, even if no actual official information has been supplied.

As mentioned when the last preview video went out (scroll down for earlier stories), the Proto Z is expected to share its underpinnings and motor with Infiniti’s performance saloons. But the fitment of a manual with that circa-400hp engine will make the Proto Z unique in Nissan and its sister brand’s line-up; and a whole lot more attractive to those who prefer the workload of three pedals, especially if they've been longing for a 370Z replacement.

It’s thanks to that old car’s performance and the capability shown by the V6 in Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 that we’re so confident the incoming machine will have around 400hp. That would place it smack bang on par with the Audi TT RS, but thanks to rear-wheel drive – also anticipated because of those Infinitis – and the manual, not to mention the Zed car’s unique design, Nissan’s offering looks well placed to play a more substantial role in the segment. But, pleasingly for us lot, it looks like the focus is first and foremost on the enthusiasts.

Previous story: 07/09/2020

Nine days before Nissan pulls the covers off its Z Proto sports car, the manufacturer has posted a video that seems to show a manual gear lever on the transmission tunnel. Oh yes. The blink-and-you’ll-miss-it clip, presumably there to get us all excited about the Z Proto’s gearbox, features an actor’s hand that grabs a lever in the manner of a manual ‘box. It’s the first potentially tangible piece of evidence to back all of the speculation behind Nissan’s upcoming two-door.

The car is also expected to come with a turbocharged V6 engine, borrowed from Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 performance models with a circa 400hp output. The platform itself is also expected to be shared with those models, making us pretty confident that the Z Proto will be rear-drive, too. A V6-powered, manual rear-drive coupe from Japan is something everyone, not just fans of the Zed lineage, can understand the significance of, especially in 2020.

Aside from the gearbox hint, today’s video does little to prove or disprove the predictions for the model’s technical setup. Earlier previews have shown that its two-door body will place its occupants in the middle, behind an extended bonnet and in front of a taut rear-end. That bodes well for balance and weight distribution, and while much of it looks new, we spot some design influences from the car's forebears, particularly at the rear.

It all has us very excited for what's to come. Rest assured we'll be keeping a close eye on Nissan’s digital channels for any more information in the coming days. All things suggest the 16th September reveal will be one well worth tuning in for.

Original story: 01.09.2020

It's been a long time coming, but now there is confirmation from Nissan that the next Zed sports car - or the Z Proto preview, at least - isn't that far off: all will be revealed on September 16th.

Which, for those of us seduced by front-engined, rear-drive, six-cylinder Nissan sports cars over the past half a century, is excellent news. Because not only have there been some real heroes over the past 50 years - the original 240 and the 350 of 2003 spring to mind - we've been waiting an eternity for a new one. There are 370Zs out there on an '09 plate, fundamentally the same package as is still available with a 2020 registration. And the Zed wasn't without flaws in the first decade of the 21st century, so it's desperately due an overhaul now.

Hopefully this Z Proto will give a good indication on what to expect; all that's seen of it in this video is the vaguest of silhouette and headlight profiles. The vid is instead dedicated to the Zed history, the enormous of amount of heritage and success that Nissan will hope to influence the new car with. Because while there have been some less than great Zed cars, if this new one can combine the best attributes of the good'ns - brawny performance, great looks, fun handling - then you'd have to assume that Nissan would be on to something. Even if the commonly accepted idea of a coupe nowadays seems to have a raised ride height and a kerbweight in excess of two tonnes.

Whether it's a 400Z, electrified or not, a conventional two seater or 2+2, the right blend of Zed characteristics will surely see Nissan right in a new car. We won't know anything more about that car for a couple of weeks, though; best then to settle in and bask in the Nissan sports car heritage. And if 58 seconds is insufficient, then there's definitely permission granted to watch Tokyo Drift as well; after all, it's not every day a new Nissan Zed car is announced...","<div><p class=""&#127950;2uDbQu &#127950;16v_t3""></p><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><p>Nissan has all but confirmed that its upcoming Proto Z sports car will use a manual and turbocharged V6 in its latest preview video.

Because not only have there been some real heroes over the past 50 years - the original 240 and the 350 of 2003 spring to mind - we've been waiting an eternity for a new one. There are 370Zs out there on an '09 plate, fundamentally the same package as is still available <a href=""Mark%20your%20diaries%20now%20-%20September%2016th%20will%20see%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20Zed%20sports%20car%20previewed"">with a 2020 registration</a>.

The vid is instead dedicated to the Zed history, the enormous of amount of heritage and success that Nissan will hope to influence the new car with. Because while there have been some less than great Zed cars, if this new one can combine the best attributes of the good'ns - brawny performance, great looks, fun handling - then you'd have to assume that Nissan would be on to something. Even if the commonly accepted idea of a coupe nowadays seems to have a raised ride height and a kerbweight in excess of two tonnes.</p><p><a href=""https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-japanesecars/new-video-previews-nissan-400z---update/41207"">Whether it's a 400Z</a>, electrified or not, a conventional two seater or 2+2, the right blend of Zed characteristics will surely see Nissan right in a new car. We won't know anything more about that car for a couple of weeks, though; best then to settle in and bask in the Nissan sports car heritage. And if 58 seconds is insufficient, then there's definitely permission granted to watch Tokyo Drift as well; after all, it's not every day a new Nissan Zed car is announced...</p><p class=""&#127950;2PaxXZ &#127950;GQIBqU""></p><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><p class=""image-gallery-index""><p class=""image-gallery-index-current"">1</p><p class=""image-gallery-index-separator""> / </p><p class=""image-gallery-index-total"">3</p></p></div>",0.16699999999999998,0.012,0.9994,WtXb3hEju6tXcVgucHWSDk,,

Do you think the Z Proto should have a manual transmission?",08/09/2020,"After years of waiting, we're now under two weeks away from seeing Nissan's replacement for the aging 370Z, the Z Proto. In an effort to drum up hype for the car, Nissan has been releasing teaser videos giving us glimpses of its retro-inspired design. This latest clip is the most exciting yet, because it hints at the possibility of a manual transmission.

The 30-second teaser, uploaded to Nissan's YouTube channel yesterday, shows us rear light clusters inspired by the 300ZX, and body lines taken from the original 240Z. But the most interesting part of the video comes near the end, where a driver is shown reaching for what seems to be a shift knob placed in the center console.

Granted, we're not ever shown what the shifter looks like, so for all we know, it could just be an automatic gear selector that Nissan is teasing. Though considering the car's sporting intentions, we're hopeful it's not.

Nissan's been coy on what'll sit under the hood of the Z Proto, but rumors have suggested it could be powered by a 400-hp twin-turbo V-6. We'll know for sure on September 15. In the meantime, head on over to our roundup post for the new Z to read up on everything else we know about the car so far.

Do you think the Z Proto should have a manual transmission? Would that entice you to buy it over something like a new Supra? Let us know in the comments.

The hefty government guarantee suggests financial firms are cautious about helping to fund the automaker as it seeks to return to profitability and stop bleeding cash.

The government has guaranteed 104 billion yen of the 180 billion in loans from the DBJ, said the source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the information is not public.

DBJ and Nissan declined to comment. The Ministry of Finance could not immediately be reached for comment.

Three other sources told Reuters in May the government would guarantee part of a loan from Mizuho Financial Group Inc , aimed at helping Nissan ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nissan had pledged to slice 300 billion yen from annual fixed costs and become a smaller, more efficient company after the pandemic exacerbated a slide in profitability that culminated in its first annual loss since fiscal 2008 in the year ended March.

Making half-a-million of any type of vehicle is impressive, but this plucky little Japanese EV has captured the hearts and minds of consumers as a genuinely viable alternative to gasoline vehicles.

Just ask Maria Jensen of Norway, who purchased the 500,000th example.

The Leaf has been in production since 2011, and since then earned its place as the world’s best-selling electric car. (It was overtaken only recently by the Tesla Model 3, which crossed a half-million units earlier this year.) In 2014 the Leaf surpassed the 100,000-unit mark, with 200,000 units sold the following year. 2018 and 2019 would see Leaf production reach 300,000 and 400,000, respectively.

The 500,000th Leaf was manufactured in Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, England. The current-gen car features a 40- to 62-kWh 350V lithium-ion battery depending on the spec, and produces between 147 and 214 horsepower.

There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997.
The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation.
1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours.
Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.",14/09/2020,"Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!

John’s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race’s ‘coulda, shoulda, woulda’ programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.

The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later. I had a look at Toyota’s effort a week or so ago, and in the shadow of this year’s great race, it also appropriate to consider another contender of the time, the Nissan R390.

After the demise of Group C and IMSA GTP in 1992 and 1993, the rules were structured to make the GT category more in tune with road cars, so the Japanese manufacturers responded by building GT versions of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Honda NSX and of course the Toyota Supra LM. These true road car evolutions were outclassed by the McLaren F1 GTR at Le Mans in 1995; not entirely unexpected given the philosophy behind Woking’s finest.

Frustrated by the multiple successes of the F1 GTR on the tracks during the BPR era of 1995 and 1996, Porsche brought a gun to the knife fight with the introduction of their 911 GT1. So it was clear that to have any prospect of success, a supercar would have to be designed and built and in double quick time too. There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997. Get the car designed and built by one of the specialists and who better than Tom Walkinshaw Racing? TWR had a record second to none in running motorsport projects for manufacturers, especially at Le Mans, where their outright wins in 1988 and 1990 for Jaguar had passed into legend.

So when Nissan wanted an answer to the question of what to do next in pursuit of victory at Le Mans the answer was to engage TWR. In addition to TWR’s experience on the track, the company still had the services of Tony Southgate, who had designed the successful Jaguars of the Group C/IMSA era. As Project Leader for TWR, Southgate came up with a state of the art chassis and bodywork made of composite materials, carbon fibre and kevlar.

Adding complexity to the whole project was the requirement to produce a road car that could be sold to the public. TWR Design was headed by Ian Callum, designer/creator of the Aston Martin DB7 and he styled and oversaw the production of the Nissan R390 road car, the fastest and most expensive road car ever produced by Nissan. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz GT1 project, Nissan created the road car first and thereby conformed to the spirit as well as the letter of the regulations. It was all in vain though, as the rules changed just before the start of the season allowing the road car to be produced any time during the calendar year. Mercedes-Benz showed their contempt for the process by unveiling their street-legal version of the CLK GTR in late December, months after the FIA GT Championship had been run and won.

Callum made styling references to the rest of the Nissan product range and heritage, using the twin front grills that gave a subliminal message “Nissan” and also the headlights had their origins in the 300SX. There were only two examples of the R390 built for the public highway, with a 0-60mph time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 220moh, all at a price tag of $1 million.

Nissan, or more accurately, NISMO rummaged around the back of the engine storeroom and found the V8 that used to power the 1990 Group C Le Mans entries. This 3.5 litre twin turbo V8, codenamed VRH35L, had been extensively updated since its previous visit to La Sarthe to cope with the new demands imposed by air restrictors, especially in the area of friction reduction. The engine had two overhead camshafts per bank of cylinders with 32 valves in total. There were 2 IHI turbos and the power “over 600bhp” was sent to the rear wheels through a transversally mounted six speed sequential gearbox designed and built by X-Trac. Tyres were provided by Bridgestone.

The final piece of the jigsaw was to assemble the team for the attempt on the world’s greatest race. Nissan had failed in their previous attempts on the French classic, most notably in 1990 when despite having the best car, political in-fighting and lack of co-operation between the British, American and Japanese teams (yes three separate teams!) they conspired to lose the race to Jaguar and TWR. This time things would be different.

While Tony Southgate headed up the TWR side of the operation, Tom Walkinshaw himself being on Grand Prix duty with Arrows, Kunihiko Kakimoto was Nissan and NISMO’s man in charge. For the race, there were 115 members of the team, 40 from TWR and the rest from Japan.

The team had a very strong pool of drivers available to them. Number 21 had TWR’s favourite son, Martin Brundle, with Jörg Müller and Wayne Taylor, a late substitute for the injured Mauro Martini, joining him behind the wheel. Number 22 was crewed by Riccardo Patrese, Aguri Suzuki and Eric Van de Poele. The third R390, number 23, had Eric Comas, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama on driving duties.

The attraction of the World’s Greatest Race is attested by the number of entries, always in excess of the track’s licensed limit. 1997 was no exception with 86 applications which the Selection Committee of the ACO whittled down to 76. These were invited to turn up at the beginning of May to see who would go forward to the race itself. One entry dropped out, six were granted exemption by virtue of 1995 results, so 69 cars scrapped for the 46 places on pit road during race week itself, some six weeks hence. Oh, and of those 46, four would go home early, all nice and clear.

For factory teams such as Nissan, this system gave a few sleepless nights, as if they did not achieve the right level of performance on the day then it was no race after all that effort and expense.

The cars were split up into two groups, one running on Saturday, the balance on Sunday. Everyone in the paddock was given a reminder of the ever-present dangers in the sport when an accident on Saturday claimed the life of the promising young French driver, Sebastian Enjolras. There was little enthusiasm for running during the rest of the day. The timesheets were topped by the McLaren F1 GTR of JJ Lehto with 3:45.973. The #22 Nissan was around three seconds back but comfortably in the race.

The pace hotted up on Sunday and as usual, the teams all put on stickier rubber as the clock ticked towards the end of the session and no one wanted to be left standing when the music stopped. For #21 there would be no worries as Martin Brundle was in outstanding form, scorching round in 3:43.152 to record the fastest time of the weekend. To complete a good weekend for the Anglo-Japanese team #23 was also in with ease. Quiet satisfaction and a job list of improvements to be made were the conclusions taken away – next up, the race!

Fastest in the Pre-Qualifying Weekend, the mood in the TWR Nissan camp would have been reasonably confident. Or it should have been: those of us on the outside had heard that there had been a successful three-day test at Magny Cours and all was plain sailing.

The more observant (not me, I hasten to add) would have questioned why the exhaust system had been re-routed from back to side, not something lightly undertaken. The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.

It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR “forgot” this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.

Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut’s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.

The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.

Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah… TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.

R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. “Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.”

Prophetic words…

Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.

As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.

“The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,” was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.

The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.

All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.

A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. “I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,” said Erik Comas. “It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.” Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.

During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with “a serious gearbox” problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.

At 4.24 am Jörg Müller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: “I agreed with my engineer that we’d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.”

What might have been… two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.

Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: “Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish”.

Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.

It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: “I believe we proved the Nissan car’s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.”

So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?

A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.

There were three ’98 spec cars and one ’97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.

The fourth R390 was the ’97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new ’98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.

As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.

In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: “I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.” He had also earned a drive in the race itself.

Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.

The simple answer was no.

Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the ’97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.

1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.

For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.

The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.

Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.

So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998’s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.

The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle’s Toyota and Schneider’s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.

In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan’s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider’s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.

Next, it was BMW’s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.

So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.

At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.

Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.

Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390’s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.

Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; Müller having a spin, damaging the Porsche’s undertray and McNish’s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.

Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.

And so that’s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan’s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.

So much for the good news.

The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:

Tokyo … Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.

Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan’s motorsports arm in August.

The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.

Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.

The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.","<div><p><strong>Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!</strong></p><br /><p>John&#8217;s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race&#8217;s &#8216;coulda, shoulda, woulda&#8217; programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.</p><br /><p>The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later.

To complete a good weekend for the Anglo-Japanese team #23 was also in with ease. Quiet satisfaction and a job list of improvements to be made were the conclusions taken away &#8211; next up, the race!</p><br /><p>Fastest in the Pre-Qualifying Weekend, the mood in the TWR Nissan camp would have been reasonably confident. Or it should have been: those of us on the outside had heard that there had been a successful three-day test at Magny Cours and all was plain sailing.</p><br /><p>The more observant (not me, I hasten to add) would have questioned why the exhaust system had been re-routed from back to side, not something lightly undertaken. The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277429"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR &#8220;forgot&#8221; this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.</p><br /><p>Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut&#8217;s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.</p><br /><p>The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.</p><br /><p>Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah&#8230; TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.</p><br /><p>R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. &#8220;Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Prophetic words&#8230;</p><br /><p>Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.</p><br /><p>As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277430"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""675""></a></p><br /><p>&#8220;The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,&#8221; was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.</p><br /><p>The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.</p><br /><p>All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.</p><br /><p>A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. &#8220;I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,&#8221; said Erik Comas. &#8220;It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.&#8221; Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277431"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with &#8220;a serious gearbox&#8221; problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.</p><br /><p>At 4.24 am J&#246;rg M&#252;ller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: &#8220;I agreed with my engineer that we&#8217;d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.&#8221;</p><br /><p>What might have been&#8230; two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.</p><br /><p>Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: &#8220;Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish&#8221;.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277432"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.</p><br /><p>It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: &#8220;I believe we proved the Nissan car&#8217;s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.&#8221;</p><br /><p>So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?</p><br /><p>A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.</p><br /><p>There were three &#8217;98 spec cars and one &#8217;97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277433"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>The fourth R390 was the &#8217;97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new &#8217;98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.</p><br /><p>As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: &#8220;I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.&#8221; He had also earned a drive in the race itself.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277434"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.</p><br /><p>The simple answer was no.</p><br /><p>Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the &#8217;97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.</p><br /><p>1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.</p><br /><p>For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.</p><br /><p>The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.</p><br /><p>Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.</p><br /><p>So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998&#8217;s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.</p><br /><p>The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle&#8217;s Toyota and Schneider&#8217;s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.</p><br /><p>In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan&#8217;s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider&#8217;s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.</p><br /><p>Next, it was BMW&#8217;s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.</p><br /><p>So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.</p><br /><p>At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277435"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.</p><br /><p>Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390&#8217;s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.</p><br /><p>Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; M&#252;ller having a spin, damaging the Porsche&#8217;s undertray and McNish&#8217;s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.</p><br /><p>Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277436"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>And so that&#8217;s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan&#8217;s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277437"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>So much for the good news.</p><br /><p>The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:</p><br /><p>Tokyo &#8230; Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.</p><br /><p>Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan&#8217;s motorsports arm in August.</p><br /><p>The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.</p><br /><p>Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.</p><br /><p>The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277438"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br />        </div>",0.083,0.079,0.9114,kpJrhQYkf4L5gcGYzckc6j,,

The news for the next-generation Micra came from Nissan’s Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta during an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.
“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.
The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants.

Gupta said that the plan for Nissan’s Ford Fiesta and VW Polo rival is part of the new ‘leader-follower’ strategy within the Alliance, which stipulates that one automaker takes the lead on specific model segments.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

The ‘leader-follower’ strategy will also put Renault in charge of the Alliance’s future small B-SUV models, such as the Renault Captur and Nissan Juke, for Europe, while Nissan will lead in the next-generation of C-SUV models, like the Qashqai (Rogue Sport in NA) and its sister model, the Renault Kadjar.

The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants. The range-topping variant is the Micra N-Line, which is powered by a turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder with 115 HP paired to a six-speed manual transmission.

- shares





The Australian arm of Japanese car maker Nissan is looking to build on the name it made for itself launching the Nissan Leaf in 2012, outlining plans to launch a full electrified range locally by 2022 – and no model is off-limits. With any luck, these plans will kick off with the recently-announced Nissan Ariya which, according to Nissan Australia's managing director Stephen Lester, is high on the wish list. ""For us in Australia we have a strong feeling that this car would be perfect for our market,"" Mr Lester told CarAdvice ahead of World EV Day on September 9. ""It would make a lot of sense in that crossover segment – the most dominant segment in the market overall – as it appeals to the widest range of drivers, from those with families looking for utility, through to empty nesters."" While the status of the Ariya in Australia remains unconfirmed, CarAdvice understands that if it were to come here, the Ariya likely wouldn't arrive in showrooms until 2022, with a price point to compete with the Tesla Model 3 (which starts from $73,900 before on-road costs).

However, Mr Lester said Nissan would consider a ""basket"" of competing brands before positioning a local offering. Though the Nissan Leaf is the third most affordable all-electric car in Australia (behind the Hyundai Ioniq and the departing Renault Zoe), buyers may not necessarily benefit from entry-level pricing across Nissan's future electric offerings. ""Obviously the lower down the price band you are, the more potential people you have that can purchase your vehicle, but what is also important is that you deliver a vehicle that does what it says it's going to do,"" Mr Lester said. Regardless of whether or not the Nissan Ariya makes it to our shores, Australian consumers should expect almost a third of the brand's local portfolio to be electrified in two years' time. ""From an Australian perspective, we expect to have 30 per cent of our portfolio electrified by 2022,"" Mr Lester said, citing both full-electric options and Nissan's e-Power hybrid technology as part of this plan.

So, what kinds of electric and hybrid models are likely to debut over the next 24-or-so months? ""As far as concepts being worked on globally, there's not a segment we're not at least looking at,"" Mr Lester said. Even an electrified ute isn't off the table, although Mr Lester suggested this might be more of a task for the litany of start-ups targeting pick-up buyers with a penchant for electrification. ""I think there's no less than three brands – not mainstream automotive brands – that have been launching in that exact space,"" he said, referring to challenger brands like Rivian, Bollinger and Nikola. ""In Australia, [utes] play a very important role in the market and I have no reason to say we won't see electric utes.""

Last year, the company confirmed it will at least add a hybrid variant to the Navara ute at some point in the future, with the next-generation model. As for whether the pioneering Nissan Leaf will remain part of the portfolio, Mr Lester wasn't definitive on the compact hatchback's future in our market. ""We see EVs in all senses being the mainstay – whether or not it's specifically the Leaf as a nameplate, time will tell,"" he explained. ""To have EVs really become part of the mainstream we need more selection and more products people want to get behind the wheel of – for the vast majority of us [a car] is something you like people to see you in, it's not just a bare necessity.""

Mr Lester also shed light on how Nissan Australia plans to tackle some of the more common barriers to electric vehicle uptake in Australia – namely: higher prices, limited charging infrastructure and the ongoing debate over the green credentials of the cars themselves. ""What most industry experts say is that by 2024, or the mid 2020s, the cost of producing an electric vehicle will be equal to that of producing an ICE vehicle, and I think that still stays in our case in the market,"" Mr Lester said. ""From a production standpoint, we’d be able to price those vehicles fairly comparably."" However, he also argued the sheer amount of technology available in electric cars, along with their ability to feed power back into the grid via bi-directional charging, could come at a price premium. ""Even in today’s case it’s not fair to take a Leaf and compare it to another vehicle of a comparable size. No other vehicle on the market offers bidirectional charging, so how can I effectively price someone else’s hatch at the same price?""

On the contentious issue of Australia's largely coal-powered electricity grid, Mr Lester said there was certainly still room to improve. ""The reality is that in this country at the moment, coal is still a part of the grid, but that doesn't mean it will be forever. There's no question the government plays a huge role in that, compared to an organic movement of people,"" Mr Lester said. As for public charging infrastructure (or lack thereof)? ""We will continue to advocate for a strong improvement in that area – there's a certain ubiquity required so consumers can feel they can get a charge then they need to,"" he explained. ""But while the idea of a petrol station being on every corner has become the norm, a lot of us didn't grow up with a bowser nearby, so it's something that organically takes some time.""

Mr Lester acknowledges that while Nissan might have been first with the Leaf, the electric car market has since ballooned to include a slew of intimidating competitors – but he believes Nissan still retains its point of difference. ""Our production and engineering are what are going to differentiate us,"" he said. ""There’s no doubt that other brands will improve but competition is great, because it fuels everybody to get better and gives consumers more choice."" MORE: Everything Nissan

You'll have to keep your eyes peeled to see all the clues in this video. It isn't until the end that we see a quick flash of a hand on what appears to be the Z Proto's new manual shifter. In another brief moment, the video also confirms what we already suspected: the Z will feature 300ZX-inspired taillights. A few days ago, Nissan design boss Alfonso Albaisa revealed a sketch of the thin, elongated lighting elements that provide a modern take on earlier Z generations, particularly the Z32 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Once again, we can see the Nissan Z Proto's attractive silhouette. The steep roof harkens back to the current 370Z, although the overall design is more fluid. A long hood, chrome strip on the roof, and sharp body lines contribute to the more streamlined look. We can clearly see design cues that reference the Zs of yesteryear, including the rounded headlights and the Z badge mounted on the C-pillar.

What remains unclear is the powertrain. The next generation may pack a 4.0-liter V-6 as rumors of a 400Z badge would suggest. Or it could get a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 from Infiniti's Red Sport 400 models. Since the upcoming reveal is a prototype, we may have to wait some time before finding out this information.","<div><p class=""_25GXi""><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nissan has dropped a new teaser video (below) that confirms that the Nissan Z Proto, and thus likely the production version that will follow, will feature a manual transmission&#8212;as hinted in an earlier teaser.

The automaker has vowed for a year that it will reduce its past reliance on heavy retail incentives and its often-contentious dealer bonus programs to move metal and build market share.

But suddenly, the market is coming back after a ruinous year for industry sales. And Nissan is turning to dealer volume incentives again as it sees an opportunity to improve its U.S. market share.

Last month, Nissan reinstated its dealer sales-objective program — often referred to in the industry as stair-step — that financially rewards retailers for hitting specific sales volume targets.

Late last week, dealers received their incentive targets for September. The sales objectives have some dealers grumbling again.

""In the last five months, dealers went through the addiction recovery process because we haven't had objectives,"" said Tyler Slade, operating partner at Tim Dahle Nissan Southtowne in suburban Salt Lake City. ""Now we're right back to our crack cocaine.""

That's not what Nissan wants, and it's not the message that the automaker's senior executives in the U.S. and Japan are now emphasizing.

""We want to continue to be reasonable and work with the dealers,"" David Kershaw, Nissan Division vice president of sales and regional operations, told Automotive News last week. ""A healthy dealer body with healthy profitability is key to our success.""

But some retailers see the automaker on a slippery slope. Georgia dealer David Basha said his factory objectives for September jumped 21 percent over his August targets, even though September sales historically are about 85 percent of August's.

""We just barely made last month's sales goal,"" said Basha, owner of Carriage Nissan near Atlanta. ""To me, it looks like the same old game of escalating objectives. We should have gotten a two-to-three-vehicle increase; instead, we got an increase of about 10 vehicles.""","<div><p class="""">Nissan is facing a test of its will in the U.S.</p><p class="""">The automaker has vowed for a year that it will reduce its past reliance on heavy retail incentives and its often-contentious dealer bonus programs to move metal and build market share.</p><p class="""">But suddenly, the market is coming back after a ruinous year for industry sales.

Ready to buy a Nissan Titan or Ram 1500?",12/09/2020,"The 2020 Nissan Titan is a new, yet established competitor in the half-ton pickup market that goes up against the 2020 Ram 1500. Let’s see how they compare.

2020 Nissan Titan





2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab Starting Price: $40,485 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; good towing capability; available 4WD; serious off-road chops in Pro-4X trim, long warranty.

Below Average: Only one drivetrain offered; high entry-level price; aging chassis and design.

Consensus: Capable and refined, the Titan offers a powerful V8 as its only drivetrain choice. With a single wheelbase for crew cab models and only five trim levels, Nissan offers a much simpler approach to the new truck buying process.

2020 Ram 1500





2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Starting Price: $33,590 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Styling; hybrid engine option; coil spring and air suspension; ride quality; rear-seat legroom.

Below Average: Upper trims get expensive; limited powertrain choices; 8- instead of a 10-speed transmission.

Consensus: The Ram offers a bold exterior without going overboard. It also offers numerous unique options like an air suspension and a massive 12-inch touch-screen infotainment setup. There’s plenty of powertrains and trims from which to choose.

Titan vs. Ram 1500: Old newcomer or new oldtimer

Nissan Titan Crew Cab

Nissan has a short history of building full-size pickups. And yet its 2020 Titan, despite a recent facelift, is older than the newly redesigned Ram 1500. As a newcomer, the Titan brings some car-buying sensibility to the truck market. Rather than offering a confusing array of drivetrains, wheelbase lengths, and packages, the Titan is much more straightforward with a single 400-horsepower V8 and 9-speed automatic drivetrain, one wheelbase length and only five trim levels. While it makes things simple, it also limits your choice. At its entry point, the Titan is thousands more than the Ram. Titan does offer a wide range of equipment from the Spartan S model up through the plush Platinum Reserve. Of special note is the off-road 4-wheel drive Pro-4X version that offers serious off-road capability. Another plus is a standard suite of driver and safety assists.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab

The Ram, fresh off a 2019 makeover, offers handsome styling, an impressive number of trims and features, and improved towing and payload numbers. The base engine is a mild hybrid 3.6-liter V6 called eTorque. That same tech is available on the workhorse 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which helps boost that model’s fuel economy numbers. The big thing that separates the Ram from other pickups is its use of a coil-spring independent rear suspension. Even in base form without the optional airbag suspension, this setup imparts a great ride without sacrificing towing or load-carrying capability. We also like the user-friendly Uconnect infotainment system. Like the Titan, there’s plenty of upscale trims to turn your workhorse into a showhorse, but you’ll pay a pretty penny. Some of that investment will be returned due to the Ram’s proven durability and good resale.

Similarities

Expansive model ranges with rear- and 4-wheel drive; top ranges offer luxury car amenities; similar entry-level sticker prices; high durability and solid resale value.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab Advantages

Coil spring rear suspension; large easy-to-use infotainment screen; more rear-seat legroom with reclining seats; lower price; hybrid engines.

Nissan Titan Crew Cab Advantages

Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; off-road Pro-4X trim; standard driver and safety assists; long warranty.

Final Recommendation

While the Nissan Titan has plenty of power from its 5.6-liter V8, that alone doesn’t close the deal here. And while you have to work harder to find the right truck from the myriad of combinations offered by Ram, you’ll likely find something that closely matches your needs at a lower price.

This time we’re getting a better look at the details of the car, specifically the ones that give it its unique Z-car characteristics.

The new Z mimics that style with a similarly shaped headlight profile, with dual half-moon shaped daytime running lights.

The taillights will follow a different vehicle’s style, the Z32 300ZX of the 1990s (even though those were just an homage to the original 240Z as well). The horizontal red lines are flush with the body, and it’s possible we could see a full-width rear light as well, as is the style these days.

Other Z-inspired touches include the badge on the C-pillar with a ‘Z’ on it, as well as — well, basically the entire shape of the body. Although the original 240Z had a straight-six and a long hood to match, the similarly styled Z-Proto will likely feature a V6, but placed far back in the engine bay for better weight distribution.

Nissan seems to have saved the best detail for last however, because right at the end of the video a person puts their hand on the gearshift lever. This could be a hint Nissan will offer the new Z with a manual transmission, something that’s been a staple of the sports car since the very beginning.","<div><p id=""gpt-bigboxmid"" class=""pn_dfpads adslot""> <br /></p><br /><p>Nissan is teasing its new sports car once again, ahead of its reveal on September 16.

""I'm confident that I'm innocent,"" said Kelly, a former Nissan representative director, who is out on bail after his arrest by Tokyo prosecutors in November 2018.

According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.
After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan.",20/09/2020,"By Noriyuki Suzuki and Takuma Obinata, KYODO NEWS - Sep 12, 2020 - 19:51 | All, Japan

Former Nissan Motor Co. executive Greg Kelly is confident that he can prove his innocence over alleged financial misconduct as his long-awaited trial begins next Tuesday in Tokyo -- without former boss Carlos Ghosn.

In an interview with Kyodo News, Kelly, 63, said he was ""not disappointed"" in Ghosn, who jumped bail and fled Japan in late 2019 to Lebanon, but he would like to have the former charismatic leader as a witness.

""I didn't violate any laws in Japan. This is a matter that, in my view, should have been resolved at Nissan. Nothing was ever promised to Carlos Ghosn. Nothing was ever paid to him,"" Kelly said in Tokyo a week before the trial.

""I'm confident that I'm innocent,"" said Kelly, a former Nissan representative director, who is out on bail after his arrest by Tokyo prosecutors in November 2018.

Kelly, who took the post in 2012, is accused of conspiring with Ghosn in underreporting the former boss's remuneration by around 9 billion yen ($84.8 million) over eight years through March 2018, in violation of Japan's financial instruments and exchange law. Nissan faces the same accusation as a company.

The prosecutors allege that there were deferred payments that Ghosn was to receive after his retirement, a scheme meant to avoid backlash to his high compensation.

""I would love to have him here as a witness because he could testify,"" Kelly said of Ghosn. ""This is a case about no promise and no pay. So I wish he was here.""

""But you know, in life, we all have to make our own decisions. And he made a decision he thought was best for him and his family.""

Kelly did not hide his frustration over the nearly two years that have passed since his arrest, saying he was ""snatched"" from his family in the United States. His planned neck surgery had to be delayed, and he has not seen his 9-month-old grandson.

""I don't think anybody in the world, for this kind of issue that should have been resolved at the corporate level, would want to wait two years in a country that's 6,000 miles from your family. Having to wait this long to even start a trial is very difficult,"" Kelly said.

Ghosn also faces a charge of aggravated breach of trust for his alleged misuse of Nissan funds, an accusation not leveled against Kelly.

Ghosn has claimed that his arrest was due to a plot by Nissan, which wanted to stop him from pursuing a merger with alliance partner and largest shareholder Renault SA, an arrangement the Japanese automaker feared would hurt its independence.

According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.

""It was very important for him, for people at Nissan, especially people in Japan, to have pride in Nissan, their company,"" Kelly said. ""My view of his value was based on what the global marketplace was.""

In 2010, Japan started requiring top executives to disclose their annual remuneration exceeding 100 million yen. Ghosn's compensation, according to the prosecutors, totaled around 2.4 billion yen in the business year through March 2018, months before his arrest.

Kelly, who used to serve as the head of human resources at Nissan, said his relationship with Ghosn is not as close as the media have portrayed it.

""Carlos Ghosn is not my friend. I respect him, and I like him, but he was my boss. So, I don't know his family. We didn't go out and drink wine together.""

With his wife in Tokyo, Kelly is now preparing for a trial that he said would last about four months in the United States, by reading piles of documents. The prosecution had 84 boxes of documents, and the defense team is still waiting for 90 percent of these materials.

After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan. The proceedings will be held using consecutive interpretation, not simultaneous.

""I'm a person in life that's more of an optimist,"" Kelly said when asked if the truth would win out. ""So, I would hope it would.""

It’s a true blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, with the video showing the driver’s palm resting on top of the car’s shifter. The teaser video is shot in a way that blocks any meaningful view of the said shifter but if you turn down the speed of the playback and you’ll see just a small part of what looks like a manual shifter.

Perhaps this is Nissan’s way of hyping -or confirming- that the new Z will offer a manual option. We can’t be 100 percent sure just yet but we also can’t see why Nissan would do this in a teaser video if they didn’t plan to offer a manual transmission in the new Z.

The upcoming Nissan Z Proto is expected to be a near-production concept of the next-generation sports car, which according to some reports it will hit the market in 2021 and others claim it would launch in late 2022.

The new Nissan Z is reportedly going to be based on a heavily updated version of the 370Z’s platform and will use the company’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine, which makes 400 HP under the bonnet of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400.

The latest teaser image of the new Nissan Z also gave us a first look at the rear end design, which appears to adopt design cues from the 300ZX. The sketch shows a series of slim LED taillights and reveals more of the Z’s sloping roofline.

Best Car Web claims the R35’s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.

According to the Japanese publication, the Final will be a collector’s items, with only about 20 units to be up for grabs with hefty price tags around the 40 million yen ($AU518,360) mark.

Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.

The Japanese publication also reports the Final’s engine will be based on that of the GT-R GT3 racecar, which suggests it could be the same unit used in the GT-R50 by Italdesign, a million-dollar-plus limited edition that marked the 50th anniversary of the nameplate.

In the GT-R50 by Italdesign, the GT-R's engine was upgraded with competition-spec turbochargers, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition and revised intake and exhaust systems.

Nissan stays ready to adjust marketing strategy to everchanging realities

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For the first time, Nissan is bringing its popular “Heisman House” to college and professional football, one of several new twists as the campaign returns for its 10th season of star-studded shenanigans. Filmed under strict social-distancing guidelines, the Heisman House spots star eight Heisman Trophy winners including Tim Tebow, Kyler Murray, Charles Woodson and Lamar Jackson and feature the all-new 2021 Rogue alongside the Nissan Sentra, refreshed TITAN and Kicks.

“Over the past six months, Nissan has pivoted multiple times to adjust to new realities, and that agility has enabled us to come up with new and entertaining ways to reach our audiences,” said Allyson Witherspoon, vice president, Marketing Communications and Media, Nissan North America. “Case in point: the ‘It’s a Heisman thing’ campaign.

“While there’s no doubt that the 2020 college football season will look different, the humor, camaraderie and excitement of the Nissan Heisman House remain relevant, perhaps even more so during this time when audiences are craving some semblance of normalcy.”

The first two spots, “ It’s Heisman Time ” and “ Bird-watching ,” begin airing on September 12. And to ensure a wide reach for the Heisman House spots, Nissan is complementing its ad dollars with placements during professional football broadcasts beginning September 14.

“With less college football this year and six of the eight Heisman winners starring in the Nissan Heisman House spots currently playing professional football, it’s a natural redirection,” Witherspoon said.

The campaign brings former Heisman Trophy winners together under one roof where they rib each other incessantly and individually prep for the season they’ve all been waiting for to get underway. Other Heisman Trophy winners featured in the campaign are Marcus Mariota, Baker Mayfield, Derrick Henry and Mark Ingram. Making its TV debut is the all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue, which has all the technology, capability and functionality to make life easier for today’s families.

With its agency partner, TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, Nissan was diligent about taking safety precautions and enforcing social distancing among cast and crew on the Heisman House set, making for a shoot unlike any other. In scenes that made it difficult for the Heisman stars to socially distance, the crew filmed them individually on a green screen piecing the segments together in post-production.

In the spot titled “Anticipation,” Tebow is driving the Rogue, Nissan’s best-selling model in the industry’s largest segment, with Murray riding shotgun. The two filmed their portions of the spot separately, each addressing their lines to a tennis ball.

The spots will run on TV across ESPN, ABC, FOX and CBS. More content will be available on Nissan’s and ESPN’s digital channels including a 3D experience at the Virtual Heisman House as well as behind-the-scenes footage and bloopers from the shoot.

Looking forward, Nissan says college and professional sporting events will remain a cornerstone of its marketing strategy.

“College sports is the largest area of Nissan’s annual media spend, and we’re committed to sharing in the excitement with customers through content they love to watch,” Witherspoon said. “Come what may, we’ll adjust and innovate as we always do.”

2023 Nissan Z: Powertrain and Performance

Anticipated to pack a stable of 400 horses, the upcoming 400Z is sure to have the power needed to properly compete with the likes of the Toyota Supra and the Porsche 718 Cayman sports coupes. Look for the new Z to rely on a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 for motivation.

Cribbed from the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400 models, the engine will likely pair with either the Infinitis' seven-speed automatic transmission or a tried-and-true manual gearbox (take that, Supra). Like past Zs, power will get sent exclusively to the coupe's rear wheels.

2023 Nissan Z: Looks and Styling

Look for the new Z's styling to ride the coattails of its predecessors. As such, buyers can anticipate retro cues that evoke the original Datsun 240Z's round headlights, long hood, and stubby rear end. Even the car's badging will embrace an old-school font.

Similarly, we expect the new Z's insides to combine modern technology with design elements that give a nod toward the past. Nissan is sure to fit the car with a trio auxiliary gauges atop its dashboard.

2023 Nissan Z: On-Sale Date and Price

We anticipate the 2023 Nissan Z will reach dealerships in the United States before the end of 2022. Although Nissan will initially sell the new Z exclusively as a coupe (with a hatch to access the cargo area), it may resurrect the model's convertible body style a year or two down the line.","<div><p class=""_25GXi"">After more than a decade on the market, <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/"">the Nissan 370Z</a> is finally retiring.

In other words, plan to cut a check for north of $45,000 to get behind the wheel of an entry-level 2023 Nissan Z. </p></div>",0.121,0.0,0.9905,JkcCzmyS8Vyw2BZKrmTxQb,,

The upcoming Nissan Magnite sub-4m compact crossover is currently undergoing an intensive testing regime to get ready for an early 2021 launch. The mini SUV which will slot below the Kicks as the company’s most affordable model in the country will be aiming to be a turnaround specialist.

Exterior and Interior Design

Thanks to leaked patent images of the production spec Nissan Magnite, we now have a better idea about the car’s design. In addition, Nissan had recently previewed the Magnite via a set of concept images. With its edgy exterior design elements and uncluttered interior layout, the crossover targets young urban audience.

The design actually originates from the Datsun Go-Cross concept which world premiered at 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. Owing to the budget brand’s poor show, the low-cost Datsun SUV failed to meet the assembly line. The Nissan Magnite is essentially a more upmarket take on the Go-Cross concept.

Platform

The Nissan Magnite SUV is underpinned by Renault-Nissan Alliance’s CMF-A+ platform which will cater to emerging market-specific products. The upcoming Nissan crossover will share its platform with the Renault Kiger which is also currently undergoing testing.

Both these products together will shoulder the responsibility of powering Renault-Nissan Alliance out of its rough patch in India. Moreover, Nissan’s future plans for India hinges on how successful the Magnite is going to be.

Powertrain

There is no official confirmation about the Nissan Magnite’s powertrain options but a 1.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine is reported to be the viable candidate. With an estimated output of 100 hp and 160 Nm of torque, the motor will be at par with the segment rivals. We expect both manual and automatic transmission options to be on offer right from day one.

With BS6 emission standards warranting expensive fixes to diesel engines, the Alliance has opted to discontinue its famed 1.5-liter dCi motor. So, like the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Nissan Magnite will be a petrol-only SUV.

Rivals and launch

In addition to Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Magnite will have to fight it out with an array of well rounded compact crossovers like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Ford EcoSport, and its own sibling, the Kiger.

Scheduled to be launched sometime in the first half of 2021, the Nissan Magnite will be heavily localized to arrive at a competitive price point. While the competition is going to be intense, the sub-4m SUV segment is also growing at a brisk rate. Will the Nissan SUV crack it?

Nissan has dropped another teaser video of the upcoming new Z sports car, and this time we can hear its engine rev and see its six-speed manual shifter.

The new Z is expected to be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that could produce up to 400 horsepower.

A concept version, called the ""Z Proto"" will be revealed on September 15.

Nissan will show us a prototype of its new Z sports car, called the Z Proto, on Tuesday next week. It'll take design cues from its predecessors—the original 240Z as well as the 300ZX of the early 1990s—and it's likely to be powered by a version of the engine found in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport. And now we know a little bit of what that engine will sound like, and that the new Z will have a glorious six-speed manual transmission (#SaveTheManuals).

Nissan

That engine is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, which produces either 300 or 400 horsepower in various versions of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60. We're not sure exactly how much power it will make in the Z, but it's possible Nissan will offer a standard model as well as a more powerful NISMO variant. And now we have confirmation that all that power will be sent rearward through a standard six-speed manual transmission.

We'll see and know more about the new Nissan Z sports car when the Z Proto makes its debut on Tuesday, September 15, and the production version should arrive sometime next year. Until then, we'll just keep listening to that twin-turbo six sing and daydream about rowing its gears ourselves.

While details regarding technical specs remain shrouded in mystery, Nissan does say the new Z car combines a “retro theme with modern technology” and that it “won’t disappoint.” Chances are the official reveal will technically involve a prototype given the use of “Proto” in the name, but it should be close to the real deal. The company took a similar approach in 2005 with the GT-R Proto, which looked almost the same as the production-ready R35 that arrived a couple of years later.

The fact it will be a prototype rather than an actual production model could mean Nissan is still putting the finishing touches on the 370Z successor. Connecting the dots, it might not hit the market until sometime next year, possibly as a 2022MY in the United States.","<div><p>Long overdue, but it&#8217;s finally here. Well, almost.

Yellow stitching is noticeable on the center console, but the do-it-yourself gearbox remains the main attraction in this brief video.</p><br />    <p class=""content-header""><br />        <h3 class=""mbn"">Gallery: Nissan Z Proto teasers</h3><br />    </p><br /><br />                <br />        <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/"" class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-main-photo-box""><br />                <br />                     <br />                     <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                <br />            </a><br />                        <p class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-count""><p class=""value"">15</p> <p class=""label"">Photos</p></p><br />                    <span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177553/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_2.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177551/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_3.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177554/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_4.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177552/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_5.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177550/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5172004/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><p>While details regarding technical specs remain shrouded in mystery, Nissan does say the new Z car combines a &#8220;retro theme with modern technology&#8221; and that it &#8220;won&#8217;t disappoint.&#8221; Chances are the official reveal will technically involve a prototype given the use of &#8220;Proto&#8221; in the name, but it should be close to the real deal.

What's HotThe original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car.",14/09/2020,"EDITOR'S NOTE: With Nissan slated to unveil a concept version of its next-generation Nissan Z sports car on September 15, we figured you'd enjoy a look back at its progenitor, the Datsun 240Z, from the fall 2010 issue of MotorTrend Classic.

When I was in high school in the 1970s, the Datsun Z was the machine the sports car crowd all wanted, and I was among them. Of course, I wanted mine in groovy root-beer brown metallic with aftermarket slot mags just like those on the pristine example in these photos. My muffler guy had a slick dual-exhaust system all sourced out and ready to go.

The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort. (The Toyota 2000GT was beautiful but rare and expensive.)

The Z had it all: Performance, Japanese reliability, an affordable sticker (although dealers did try to mark them up, of course), and all the right hardware. The car magazines raved about them, and so did everyone I knew who owned or was somehow able to test drive one.

Launched initially only as a two-seater, the budget Jaguar E-Type formula was clear and present: long hood, short deck, a revvy overhead-cam six, independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, a four-speed transmission, and full gauges—real sports car credentials. The 2.4-liter SOHC six was an upsized relative of Datsun's robust 2.0-liter I-4. Both are composed of an iron block with an aluminum OHC head; induction came courtesy of dual side-draft Hitachi carbs. The only trans offered in the U.S. was a four-speed manual (other markets got a five-speed, and an optional three-speed automatic showed up in 1971). Although 150 horsepower doesn't sound like much these days, it was plenty for a close-coupled sport coupe weighing around 2,400 pounds.

The interior is handsome enough and comfortable for even the tallest occupants. The switchgear is pure 1970s Japanese, a bit plasticky and the materials are not terribly robust. Dashes are often cracked and covered with a woven mat of some sort. Much of the interior trim is quilted vinyl, which is commonly recovered with carpeting; reproduction kits are available. The factory wood steering wheel is an expensive piece; cracked ones can be repaired.

The aftermarket erupted with body modifications and go-fast goodies. Many early Zs have been heavily modified. It's our suggestion to stay away from these pieces, unless that's your taste and modification is what you intend to do with the car anyway.

Many have been bobbed of their bumpers, and more than a few Chevy V-8s have found their way beneath those long Datsun hoods. It's getting harder to find unmolested, original examples. Good ones command a premium, but they're a value as opposed to trying to bring a clapper back from the dead.

We asked one owner the three most important problem issues to look for, and he said, ""Rust, rust, and rust."" The factory's rustproofing efforts were so-so, and these cars trap water in all kinds of places. The bases of the tailgates rust out, plus the usual spots like doorsills, rocker panels, around the windshields, and the edges of the fenders. Pay more for a rust-free example; it'll be cheaper and nicer in the end. Carburetor linkages can be finicky, and fuse blocks are known to melt down. Modified, overly stiff suspensions can cause cracks in the frame, especially near suspension mounting points.

Z engines love frequent oil changes and a fresh 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water to make sure the iron block and alloy head don't develop corrosion in the cooling system. The shifter is a bit sloppy in its gates, although the trans and clutch are relatively long-lived items if the car hasn't been abused. Clunky suspensions indicate worn bushings, although replacement parts are plentiful.

Back to rust for a moment. Have the car checked to ensure its suspension pickup and mounting points are solid and not rusted away. Installing new shocks, fresh bushings, and wheel bearings in a high-mile car will usually accomplish wonders for ride, handling, and running noise reduction.

Avoid cars that have been crashed and poorly repaired or cheaply repainted. The Z has many subtle body lines, and they often get lost in translation if the car has been oversanded or too-thickly painted.

Factory rolling stock on early 240Zs consisted of 5.5-inch steel wheels with hubcaps. Junkyards were filled with them in the 1970s, although finding clean originals is a little tougher today. Most cars have had a swap to wider, aftermarket rims by now. No problem, but don't go crazy on width; 7.0 inches seems a comfortable maximum so as not to overstress the suspension, increase the steering effort too much, wear the steering system, and/or kill the ride.

Most of the rest of the usual ""buying an old sports car"" rules apply: Find an expert to give the car you're looking at a thorough inspection, plan on some recommissioning expenses, drive, and enjoy. Even though it is not strictly original, many owners recommend installing a strut tower brace in the engine compartment, which connects the front shock towers and adds structural rigidity to the front part of the frame.

These Datsuns were successful race cars, too. Peter Brock's BRE team tore up the West Coast Sports Car Club of America events at the wheel of a Z, and one P.L. Newman, driving for Bob Sharp Racing in Connecticut, did the same on the right coast, as well. Sharp himself won two SCCA national titles aboard Zs.

A tight, crisp 240 still defines the Datsun Z-car experience, and they're sure to be most collectible in the future. Any 240Z in good fettle is great fun and should be a drivable weekend sports car.

Datsun Z: Through the Years

1971 The transmission and rear differential were mildly revised. Optional automatic transmission offered.

1972 Compression ratio was reduced on U.S. models.

1973 The engine and intake systems further revised to meet emissions requirements, and the Z grew larger, rubber-capped bumpers to meet the new crash specs.

1974 The engine was enlarged to 2.6 liters, and the car became the 260Z for one year only. It's still substantially the same piece, but most collectors prefer the more ""pure,"" pre-crash bumper 240s. A new 2+2 body style was offered at the same time.

1975 Another bump in displacement begat the 280Z. This stretched out the original Z's body shape and platform through the 1978 model year. Some of the performance losses were regained via the displacement bump and the addition of fuel injection (280Z only), but the 260s and 280s are heavier and don't feel as spirited and lithe as the first-generation Z.

1979 The original Z is redesigned and renamed the 280ZX. The new car is larger, roomier, and relies more on electronics. T-tops were also offered, although they tended to leak and reduced the chassis structural rigidity. The two-seat and 2+2 body styles continue, running an updated version of the fuel injected 2.8-liter engine that made its debut on the 280Z. The original Zs remain the most highly sought among them, but there is a small but growing groundswell of collector interest in 280ZXs.

Special Datsun Z Models

During the Z-car's production hiatus, Nissan offered a program where it acquired solid 240Zs and contracted with an independent Southern California specialist called Pierre Z to restore them. In 1997, you could buy one through a Nissan dealer; they're identified by a small plaque on the console, just aft of the shifter. The cars were restored to near factory original condition using OEM parts and cost $25,000- $29,000. Or you could bring Nissan your Z, and it would put it through the process. Either way, you got a nearly new 25-year-old car backed by Nissan, and they bring strong prices today if maintained and still in good shape.

What's Hot

The original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car. A good supply of OEM and aftermarket parts are available, and the cars are relatively straightforward to work on. There are several parts companies and shops that specialize in Zs.

What's Not

Many cars have been highly modified, ridden hard, and put away wet (and rusty). Inspect carefully and seek out solid examples. Better cars will cost more up front and be less costly and more enjoyable to own in the long run.

Hot Tip

Pay more if you need to for a car in top condition; you'll save money in the long run.

Avoid

Rusty, previously crashed (hard), and heavily modified cars with engine swap.

Most Collectible Datsun Z

Clean, stock, original 1970 240Z.

Best Performer

Ditto.

Best Daily Driver Datsun Z

Any year 240 works well for moderate duty, although they don't get great fuel mileage—something to consider if you plan to use your 240Z as a daily runner. The '73 model's drivability suffered given revised emissions controls. Some prefer the later 280Z as an everyday driver because the larger displacement and the addition of fuel injection improved cold starts and drivability.

Bottom Line

A Japanese sports car icon then and today, and respected as a classic from a country that doesn't yet have many. Buy the best one you can find and afford. Also makes a great weekend club racer, and minor mods can enhance performance substantially.

The original Zs remain the most highly sought among them, but there is a small but growing groundswell of collector interest in 280ZXs.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Special Datsun Z Models</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">During the Z-car's production hiatus, Nissan offered a program where it acquired solid 240Zs and contracted with an independent Southern California specialist called Pierre Z to restore them. In 1997, you could buy one through a Nissan dealer; they're identified by a small plaque on the console, just aft of the shifter. The cars were restored to near factory original condition using OEM parts and cost $25,000- $29,000. Or you could bring Nissan your Z, and it would put it through the process. Either way, you got a nearly new 25-year-old car backed by Nissan, and they bring strong prices today if maintained and still in good shape.</p><p class=""_2sj8T""></p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>What's Hot</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">The original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car. A good supply of OEM and aftermarket parts are available, and the cars are relatively straightforward to work on. There are several parts companies and shops that specialize in Zs.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>What's Not</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Many cars have been highly modified, ridden hard, and put away wet (and rusty).

Better cars will cost more up front and be less costly and more enjoyable to own in the long run.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Hot Tip</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Pay more if you need to for a car in top condition; you'll save money in the long run.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Avoid</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Rusty, previously crashed (hard), and heavily modified cars with engine swap.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Most Collectible Datsun Z</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Clean, stock, original 1970 240Z.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Best Performer</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Ditto.</p><p class=""_2wXkx""><h3>Best Daily Driver Datsun Z</h3></p><p class=""_25GXi"">Any year 240 works well for moderate duty, although they don't get great fuel mileage&#8212;something to consider if you plan to use your 240Z as a daily runner. The '73 model's drivability suffered given revised emissions controls.

FRAMINGHAM – Crosspoint Associates has acquired a 2.75 acre site adjacent to its Whole Foods Marketplace on Route 9 in Framingham, allowing the Newton-based developer to proceed with plans to significantly expand the upscale grocery store.

Formerly home to the Colonial Nissan auto dealership, the property includes a 19,500 square foot showroom/office/flex space.

The deal was brokered by Bernard Gibbons of the Cambridge-based Associated Brokerage Group (ABG), who represented the seller, Empire Management Corp., and procured the buyer.

“Grocery-anchored shopping centers have been one of the few bright spots for retail during this health crisis, and the acquisition of the Colonial dealership allows Crosspoint to expand the size of the store and retain its anchor tenant,” said Gibbons. “The strategic location on Route 9, coupled with the value that a Whole Foods delivers to a retail center, allowed us to achieve record pricing for this parcel.”

This spring, Crosspoint indicated to the Framingham Planning Board that if the store was not allowed to expand to conform to the Whole Foods prototype, the grocer would need to seek a new location.

The deal keeps Whole Foods in Framingham.

The acquisition of the site allows Crosspoint to expand the retail center – which currently includes a Starbucks, TD Bank, Pilates studio, a waxing salon and one vacant retail space – by 14,089 square feet to 77,249 square feet, with the Whole Foods store expanding by 7,163 square feet to 43,617 square feet.

The former Nissan dealership would be home to a mixture of new retail spaces, including a new building for Starbucks complete with a drive-thru area.

The new retail center is being designed by HFA. Boston Real Estate Advisors principal Craig A. Barker represented Crosspoint Associates in the transaction.

The City of Framingham had assessed the property at $2,925,000

The 500,000th Leaf came off the production line in Magnetic Red paint and is making its way to a customer in Norway. It was produced at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, where 175,000 of the electric cars have been manufactured since 2013.

The Leaf has been around for a decade now, winning several accolades during its tenure on the world’s roads, including World Car of the Year 2011, as well as Car of the Year in Europe and Japan in the same year. Until earlier this year it was the bestselling electric car ever, before being surpassed by the Tesla Model 3, which sold 300,000 units in 2019 alone.

According to Nissan, Leaf owners have driven 14.8bn “clear air kilometres” (9.2bn zero emission miles) since 2010, in the process preventing 2.4bn kg of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere from exhausts.

The Sunderland plant that produced the 500,000th Leaf has had a tumultuous time of late, being spared from closure as part of streamlining plans earlier this year. However, Nissan Boss Ashwani Gupta said that the factory, the UK’s biggest car making plant, could still be in jeopardy due to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

The current version of the Leaf comes with two range options: the standard 40kWh battery, designed for city driving, comes with an estimated 168-mile range, whereas the e+, with a 62kWh battery designed for a longer commute, is rated at 239 miles on a single charge. The basic Acenta spec starts at £26,485.

Although competition to the Leaf was comparatively scarce 10 years ago, the Leaf now acts as the veteran in a rapidly expanding sector of the EV market. Hatchbacks such as the VW ID.3, the Mini Electric and the Peugeot e-208 all vie for the same customers, but now in its second generation, the Leaf can claimed to be a tried and tested family favourite.

Nissan introduced another electric car to its line-up earlier this year in the form of the Ariya, a pure-electric SUV with a claimed range of 310 miles. Nissan previously said that it wanted an eight-strong lineup of electric cars by 2022.

Nissan’s head of electric passenger cars, Helen Perry, said that the company believes people want to make a positive environmental change in their driving habits after seeing air pollution drop over the course of the coronavirus lockdown.

She said: “Consumers have seen what cleaner air and reduced noise pollution feel like during lockdowns,” said Perry. “Now more than ever, they’re looking to take positive steps towards a more sustainable future and the Nissan Leaf contributes to this effort.”

Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.
Sunderland will become Nissan’s only European plant after the brand shuts its Barcelona factory at the end of the year.
Nissan had planned to shift production of the new generation of the X-Trail midsize SUV to Sunderland but reversed that last year in a decision that was partly interpreted as a lack of confidence in the UK as a production location.
Despite the changes, Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told the French newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Monday the Sunderland plant ""is the best performing of all the Nissan sites.",07/09/2020,"Nissan has delayed the start of European production of its new Qashqai for more than six months, according to a report.

Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.

The delay is largely due to the coronavirus crisis, the report said.

One source told the newspaper that there is a benefit to the delay, which is that it should give Nissan better visibility of the UK's trade relationship with the European Union, which is currently being negotiated following Brexit. The existing agreement expires at the beginning of 2021.

""I don’t think anyone is upset that COVID has pushed it back,"" the source said.

The downside is the delay in replacing Nissan’s top-seller in Europe. The Qashqai has already been losing ground against rivals in the key compact SUV segment, which it has traditionally led.

July sales of the Qashqai fell 27 percent to 13,128, well behind the segment-leading Volkswagen Tiguan at 21,397 and only fractionally ahead of the Peugeot 3008 at 12,699 and the Toyota C-HR at 11,964, figures from market research JATO Dynamics show.

The delay is also a blow to workers at the Sunderland plant, which has been affected by a series of job cuts related both to the slump in demand due to the coronavirus lockdowns and Nissan’s repositioning of the brand in Europe that calls for fewer but more profitable sales.

Nissan eliminated a third shift at the plant last year and does not plan to reinstate it, despite rising demand for the new Juke small SUV made there. The automaker said there was no plan to remove the Qashqai from the plant, despite the company’s warning earlier this year that Sunderland would be ""unsustainable"" if the UK and EU failed to reach a free trade deal, which remains possible given the lack of progress in the negotiations.

""Preparations in Sunderland continue for the launch of the new Qashqai, which represents a 400 million pound (445 million euro) investment in the plant,"" a spokesman told Automotive News Europe. ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

Sunderland will become Nissan’s only European plant after the brand shuts its Barcelona factory at the end of the year.

Nissan had planned to shift production of the new generation of the X-Trail midsize SUV to Sunderland but reversed that last year in a decision that was partly interpreted as a lack of confidence in the UK as a production location. The X-Trail will be built only in Japan.

Despite the changes, Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told the French newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Monday the Sunderland plant ""is the best performing of all the Nissan sites.

In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.
The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.
The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court.
As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.

The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.

In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.

The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year. The amount paid to Ghosn was allegedly underreported by 9.1 billion yen ($85.8 million) over eight years.

Nissan was also charged as a corporation for violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, to which the automaker pleaded guilty in Tuesday's hearing.

The biggest issue in the trial is whether money classified as ""unpaid remuneration"" actually exists.

The defense team for Kelly, a former representative director, claims the remuneration in question was not executive compensation, as it was planned to reward Ghosn for his services to Nissan after his retirement.

Kelly's defense maintains that even if there was an obligation to report the alleged remuneration, he cannot be held criminally responsible simply because of not reporting payment.

Two Nissan whistleblowers -- a former head of the company's secretary's office and a former company executive who is a foreign national -- previously reached plea bargains with the Special Investigation Department of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office.

But Kelly's defense team is poised to question the deals, claiming that the circumstances of how it was negotiated are unclear.

Prosecutors point out that the information disclosure system concerning executive remuneration of 100 million yen or more, which was introduced from the fiscal year ended March 2010, triggered an investigation leading to the scandal.

Ghosn had received more than 1 billion yen in annual remuneration, an amount he wanted to remain private, which lead him to allegedly order Kelly and other aides to find ways to avoid reporting part of the money.

According to the indictment, Kelly conspired with Ghosn to understate Ghosn's executive remuneration by a total of 9.1 billion yen in Nissan's annual securities reports from the fiscal year ended March 2011 to March 2018.

The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.

More than 10 people -- including former Nissan President Hiroto Saikawa as well as the two Nissan executives who reached a plea bargain -- are expected to testify. No dates have been set yet for closing arguments or a ruling.

The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court. It begins with Kelly's arraignment, in which the presiding judge questions the defendant.

Kelly, who is a licensed U.S. attorney, joined Nissan through the company's North America unit and became an executive managing officer in 2008. As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office. He was promoted to representative director in 2012.

Kelly retained that position after he returned to the U.S. in 2015 until he was arrested in November 2018.

Since being released on bail in late December 2018, Kelly has been preparing for trial in the hope of finishing it as soon as possible due to a chronic health issue involving his neck.

He has already appeared for the pretrial arrangement proceeding, which was held behind closed doors. Reports say he grew visibly irritated over the slow pace of the proceedings.

Ghosn, who prosecutors allege to be the lead figure in the case, fled Japan by hiding in a box that was subsequently loaded onto a private jet and flown to Lebanon via Turkey. According to sources close to the situation, Kelly appeared surprised at the news of Ghosn's escape, saying he was not aware of it.

At a Beirut news conference he called in early January, Ghosn said Kelly was criminally charged because he refused to participate in what Ghosn described as a ""suspicious"" plea-bargaining agreement, unlike the two other Nissan executives who did.","<div><p>TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.</p><p>The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.</p><p>In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.</p><p class=""ads__upper-inline-container""></p><p>The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for a businessman once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But lost in the small print was the same-day arrest of Kelly, and with Ghosn now in Lebanon as an international fugitive after jumping bail and fleeing Japan last year the American lawyer is the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

He faces a single charge -- conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 Tuesday and is out on bail living in an aparftment in Tokyo, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question fraught with technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Vast amounts of evidence

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast trove of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted -- despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.

The 30-second clip gives us the opportunity to see the revised Z logo and check out those alloy wheels with a five double-spoke design and Z-branded brake calipers lurking from behind. In case you’re not sure what sort of car you’re looking at, the tires have prominent Nissan and Z lettering on the sidewall that might remain a prototype-only affair.

We also get to hear the roar of the engine, presumably a V6. It’s said to use a twin-turbo 3.0-liter adapted from the Infiniti Q60 Red Sport 400 where it makes 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) of torque, but that remains to be seen. For what it’s worth, Nissan says the Z Proto will be “powerful,” not to mention “iconic” and “retro” as per the video’s description on YouTube.

With still a few days left until the much-awaited debut, we have a feeling Nissan has at least one more teaser prepared for its new rear-wheel-drive coupe.","<div><p>Next Tuesday, September 15 at 8:30 PM EDT, the wraps are finally going to come off the new Z sports car.

We’ve already said that Nissan hasn’t left itself much time to squeeze in the de riguer new car teaser campaign for the ‘Z-Proto‘. But the Japanese manufacturer is damn well trying - the titbits of information are coming thick and fast ahead of the concept’s 16 September reveal. We’ve already seen Nissan vice president of design Alfonso Albaisa show a design sketch of the car’s 300ZX-like rear end, and a couple of days ago there was yet another teaser we ignored since it didn’t really reveal anything new. This latest one for the Z-Proto - a concept which previews the 370Z-replacing ‘400Z’ - is a little more significant, however.

Expect the tyre lettering to disappear when the production version arrives...

We get a clear shot of the centre console, revealing a manual gearbox. As a bonus, we can also see a manual handbrake - remember those? Meanwhile, up and to the right, there’s what looks to be a button to activate an auto rev-matching feature, as also found in the 370Z. There are some brief shots of the exterior as a bonus, giving a glimpse of the coupe’s wheels. Want to buy a Nissan?

Underlining its exclusivity, Nissan will limit the production of the Final Edition to just 20 units. The GT-R R35’s Final Edition is said to use the same engine as the GT-R50 by Italdesign and it generates a peak torque of 750 Nm. It is powered by a 3.8-litre twin turbocharged V6 engine with several performance upgrades.

The GT-R50 by Italdesign is tuned by Nismo and it uses turbos from GT3 version of the GT-R used on race tracks. It also boasts larger intercoolers. It aids in increased flow in fuel injectors while the six-speed dual clutch automatic transmission and other components have also been upgraded to meet the desired specifications.

The report went on to say that the GT-R R35 Final Edition will cost around 40 million yen (Rs. 2.76 crore) – costlier than the GT-R Nismo but far lesser than the GT-R50 that costs more than a million. Bear in mind, these are just speculations currently but bringing up a Final Edition only makes sense for a car of GT-R iconic status.

As for the next-gen R36 model, reports indicate that the chassis will be adaptable to multiple powertrains, as an all-electric version or a hybrid variant is highly possible using kinetic energy recovery system borrowed from GT-R LM Nismo race car.","<div><img width=""1068"" height=""695"" class=""entry-thumb"" src=""https://gaadiwaadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nissan-gt-r-1-1068x695.jpg"" alt=""nissan gt-r-1"" title=""nissan gt-r-1""><p class=""td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_top td_uid_2_5f6035d958458_rand td_block_template_1 ""><br /> <br /></p><br /><br />   <br /><br /><p class=""gaadi-before-content"" id=""gaadi-1459542553""> <br /> <br /> <br /></p><h2>Nissan GT-R Final Edition will have its production limited to approximately 20 units and it will reportedly launch in 2022 using GT-R50 by Italidesign&#8217;s upgraded V6 powertrain</h2><br /><p>Nissan has a long history of selling sports cars and the GT-R does deserve a hall of fame for what it has really been over the years without much changes.

Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R.",10/09/2020,"A new report out of Japan suggests that the Nissan GT-R, aka Godzilla, will be bowing out the opposite of gracefully with a high-zoot model that will mark the end of this generation.

That same report suggests it will be a bit before any replacement for the flagship performance car will reach the market.

According to the report from Best Car Web cited by Motor1, the next GT-R is expected to arrive in 2023. That means the current car will say goodnight in 2022 with a limited-edition model, again according to the report. If this is true, just 20 units will be produced, all making 710 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque, using the engine from the Italdesign GT-R50. That 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 was massaged by NISMO and the turbos themselves came from the GT3-class GT-R race car.

The intercoolers are larger, the fuel injectors are high-flow, and the six-speed dual-clutch automatic gets beefed up to handle the power.

This car, should it arrive as described, won’t be cheap. Motor1 pegs the car at around $380,000, given Best Car Web’s estimate of much yen this vehicle will cost in Japan and current exchange rates. Those rates will change between now and 2022, of course. Regardless, it’s likely that this rumored car will cost quite a bit more than the 2021 Nissan GT-R NISMO and its $210,740 price tag. That said, the Italdesign car is worth a cool million, so in a sense, you’d be getting that powertrain for a relative bargain.

If the report is true, that is. Speculative reporting on product always requires a bit of skepticism (yes, I know we’re reporting on it, too) for whatever reason. Automakers change plans, sources are wrong, et cetera. It’s also worth noting that the link that takes you to BCW now is all about Subaru, meaning either Motor1 grabbed the wrong link or the piece has been updated.

Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R. Especially as the current car will be a decade and a half old by 2022.

There’s a lot of anticipation for the next GT-R, but the current one could make some waves on the way out the door.

Maxime Bouladier-L’Écuyer, a 32-year-old drag racer and top-speed runner, was trying to set a Canadian top speed record this past weekend at a RaceTheHalf event on an airport circuit near Maniwaki, Quebec.

His car of choice, the OB Prestige Auto Nissan GT-R nicknamed the Alpha Queen, is reputed to pump out nearly 3,300 horsepower at the crankshaft – it’s actually been measured to boast 2,842 hp at the wheels – an incredible feat made possible only because the car’s builders, Chicago’s AMS Performance, have somehow managed to find a way to pump in 77 psi of boost without blowing the twin-turbo V6 to smithereens.

More importantly, certainly for Bouladier-L’Écuyer considering the weekend’s denouement, the Alpha Queen also has a fully NHRA-approved roll cage. So when the AMS Performance Nissan’s chute failed to open – after he had set a Canadian record of 372 km/h, mind you – it tumbled off the end of the half-mile track, ending up on its roof, bodywork severely crumpled and its great honking turbochargers torn asunder.

[UPDATE: The car’s builders, AMS Performance, have since determined that the chutes functioned correctly, but that the driver failed to activate them at the proper time.]

But as its owner, Olivier Benloulou, founder of the Ideal Protein supplement supplier, said, “The car did its job. It won the race. More importantly, it saved the life of our driver.”

“It’s that security cage that made the difference. Without it, the car would have been pulverized into pieces,” he added, not really needing to note how much more serious Bouladier-L’Écuyer’s non-life-threatening injuries might have been without the welded-up high-strength steel bars.

Likely to be powered by 1.0-litre naturally aspirated and turbo-petrol options.

Expect prices to start from Rs 5.5 lakh (ex-showroom).

It’s been a couple of months since Nissan unveiled the Magnite sub-4m SUV in concept form and we’ve only gotten glimpses of the production-spec model testing in extensive camouflage in India. Well now, leaked patent images reveal more on what to expect from the production-spec Magnite which isn’t too different from the concept. It’s slated to launch in 2021.

On the outside, the Magnite retains most of the concept’s bold design elements, especially at the front with a large single-piece front grille, sculpted hood, sharp headlights, and ‘L’ shaped LED DRLs. But once you get towards the overall silhouette, that’s where the differences lie. The SUV has a lower ride height than the concept which featured large fancy wheels. Also, the cladding has been slightly toned down. At the rear, the wraparound tail lights and integrated roof spoiler are retained with the bumper and cladding cleaner than the concept. It shares its CMF-A+ platform with the upcoming Renault Kiger sub-4m SUV.

The interiors are yet to be revealed but the concept showcases a minimalistic yet funky layout. It’s also set to be loaded with features such as cruise control, 360-degree camera and connected car tech. Expect more bits such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, climate control, and maybe even a sunroof. Safety kit could include around four airbags, ABS with EBD, and electronic stability control.

Under the hood, the Magnite could be powered by a 100PS 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 72PS 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine seen in the Renault Triber. A standard manual gearbox and a CVT option for the turbo-petrol motor could be the gearbox options on offer.

The Nissan Magnite is likely to retail from Rs 5.5 lakh onwards. It will take on the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport and Mahindra XUV300. There’s more competition on the way from the upcoming Kia Sonet, sibling Renault Kiger, and Toyota Urban Cruiser.

“We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months,” added the Japanese carmaker.

According to the FT, this delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered development and changed the company’s priorities. The delay could also give Nissan more time to figure out what to do in case Britain doesn’t secure a post-Brexit deal with the European Union.

Two thirds of the 500,000 cars produced by Nissan in Sunderland annually are Qashqai crossovers.

As for what we may expect from a visual standpoint, the next-gen Qashqai / Rogue Sport will feature similar proportions to its predecessor and will adopt Nissan’s latest design language, meaning a more angular aesthetic, as seen on the latest Juke.

We can also expect a modern dashboard design, with a larger infotainment display and upgraded safety tech.

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault will develop and assemble the next generation of partner Nissan’s Micra models, a senior executive at the Japanese firm said, as the two companies try to reboot their alliance with tighter cooperation in production.

Ashwani Gupta, Nissan’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with France’s Le Monde newspaper published on Monday that the Micra plan was an example of their “leader-follower” strategy, with one firm taking the lead on certain car types.

Nissan Micra models are already assembled at Renault’s Flins factory in France, although that site is set to be turned over to recycling activities around 2024, when the life cycle of the car ranges made there expires.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

Both struggling financially, Renault and Nissan have cleared the decks of old managers and outlined joint cost-saving plans as they try to move on from a scandal surrounding former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn.

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.
The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.
""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.
DEFENCE REMAINS CONFIDENTDespite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".",15/09/2020,"TOKYO: The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: Did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen (US$87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

""I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG""

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Kelly is accused of conspiring to under-report money promised to Ghosn after retirement, an accusation he denies AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win more than 99 per cent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

DEFENCE REMAINS CONFIDENT

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.","<div><p>TOKYO: The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.</p><p>Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p></p><br />     <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.</p><p>And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.</p><p></p><br />            <img class=""picture__image lazyload"" alt=""Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019""><br />            <br />                    <br /><br />Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI<br />            <br />    <p>The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.</p><p></p><br />    <br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing.

Some of us instead have to wait for depreciation to take its toll, and that’s where early examples of the second-generation Nissan Leaf come in.

Here’s a car that provides all of the practicality of a family hatchback and plenty of modern safety technology, and since the Leaf remains one of the most popular EVs, there are loads of second-hand examples for sale.

You can find a well-specified, mid-range 2018 Leaf for £20,000 or so – a substantial saving of around £7000 compared with the list price of a new one.

There are two motor/battery combinations: the standard Leaf uses a 40kWh pack and a 148bhp motor, while the pricier Leaf e+ gets a 62kWh pack and a 214bhp motor.

The regular model has a 0-60mph time of around 8.0sec, making it much nippier than conventionally powered rivals. And in the Leaf e+, you actually need to be a bit gentle with your right foot when accelerating out of junctions, otherwise you’ll spin its front wheels.

There’s a choice of trims, but entry-level Visia is best avoided – unless you’re a fan of hair shirts. In fact, that model was dropped shortly after launch, because most buyers went for the next step up, Acenta, to get 16in alloy wheels, blindspot monitoring, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, a reversing camera and a 7.0in touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

Arrive at a corner and the Leaf remains fluent, thanks to little body lean and well-weighted steering. Grip is good too, and while the handling won’t inspire you, it’s reassuringly safe and secure. The ride comfort is generally very good as well, with only larger bumps catching out the Leaf.

In terms of refinement, the rival Volkswagen e-Golf is better, but the Leaf still impresses. Obviously, there’s no engine noise to disturb the calm, but a little bit of wind noise and road noise do make their presence known, while the suspension transmits the odd clunk.","<div><p>Not everyone can afford a pricey new electric car, no matter how much less it would cost to fuel.

At this point, it’s not completely clear whether the new Z car will be a production model or, rather, a near-production concept. We expect it to be very close to the final production form of the 370Z’s successor but the said coupe probably won’t hit the market for another 6 to 12 months from now.

Under the hood, the Z Proto will most likely get a version of Nissan’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine. If we have to be completely accurate, it’s Infiniti’s 3.0 V6 we are talking about, which is available with up to 400 horsepower (298 kilowatts) and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) in the Red Sport 400 models. The good news is a six-speed manual gearbox will be offered alongside a seven-speed automatic.

We are not completely sure there won’t be yet another teaser before the big debut tomorrow. If it arrives, we are here to share it with you.

That's exactly the amount of reading that it took for me to figure out that Matt Ashby is about as true a car enthusiast as anyone will ever be. When you ask someone to help tell the story of their car, you get wildly varied responses. Most people will tell you the specs of their build, maybe tossing in a little excerpt on how they got the car. Sometimes, you'll just get a cold listing of all the parts they've used. Other times, it's a story about the inspiration for their build with very little specifics. Usually they won't dive headfirst into their entire automotive history, though Matt certainly did, and I'm very glad to have listened to his full story firsthand.

The context into the start of his automotive obsession very much reminds me of myself, my circle of friends and so many of our peers. Just like us, he grew up on magazines like Super Street, anxiously awaiting a new issue, only to flip through it and start all over again. He was immediately hooked on the Fast and the Furious franchise and chose an EK Honda Civic hatchback as his first build. From the one picture I saw, I wouldn't be surprised to pick up an old magazine and see his Civic published in all of its early 2000s glory.

Matt moved on from the Honda scene and got into Euros, some hot rods and even trucks. His resume is quite impressive in the truck world, including a 2017 Ford Super Duty that was featured in the RBP (Rolling Big Power) SEMA booth. If you're picturing a typical SEMA ""BroDozer"" in your head, you're almost correct; the big difference being that his is the kind that's built right. He's a stickler for the details and it shows. When the time came to switch gears back into Japanese cars, he dug deep into his past and drew inspiration from '90s and '00s tuner magazines. It's no surprise that he landed on an S-chassis Nissan, and what better platform than a real JDM S13 Silvia.

This '93 Nissan Silvia Club K's was sourced from importing specialist Driver Motorsports and Matt got to work immediately. It's not an easy task to make an S13 unique these days, so he spent countless hours searching the internet for ideas, finally landing on Hikaru Taguchi's Moontech Silvia as his main inspiration. Showcased at the Tokyo Auto Salon earlier this year, the S13 was one of only a few to sport the Pandem V3 kit at the time. Once Matt decided that this was the look he wanted, he started the monumental task of sourcing the kit. Turns out eBay ended up being the place to find one. The seller assured him that it was authentic and even ended up driving halfway across the country to deliver it. Once he met the seller, Tatsuro Watanabe of HPI Racing, there was no question it was in fact, legit.

The commanding exterior feature of Matt's S13 is the Pandem kit. The matching ducktail and rear wing fit right in with the Origin Lab carbon roof spoiler, carrying that signature aggressive style to the back of the car. Keeping with the carbon accents, he reached out to Bomex and got a set of side mirrors and a front grille made in carbon to match. All of the bodywork is bolted together with burnt titanium hardware from Dress Up Bolts and draped in a two-tone white and purple paint scheme. There's also that livery, made up of a few different layers and inspired by the '90s graphics from Advan and HKS.

If the Pandem kit wasn't enough to set this S-chassis apart, the wheels should seal the deal. When Matt picked up the kit, he knew the matching Pandem 6666 wheels were something he just had to get his hands on, but he couldn't figure out who actually sold or manufactured them. After searching around and coming up short, he reached out to Tatsuro. Turns out, he had a set available, spec'd in 18x9.5"" front, 18x11"" -rear, that would fit the S13 perfectly. Not only that, those massive fenders allow room for a set of 265- and 285-series Federal tires that give the Silvia just enough meat to look functional but not so much that it takes away from the hunkered down stance.

Matt went with a set of Fortune Auto coilovers to tighten up the handling and dial in the ride height. Fortune's air piston lift system was added to help alleviate the stress that comes with an expensive front lip and a lowered car. The S13 has a host of adjustable suspension components from GKTECH and ISR to keep the car planted when driven to the limit, and controllable when sliding around for fun. For a bit more stopping force, 300ZX brakes were retrofitted up front along with StopTech rotors and pads.

The engine is the original 205hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged Red Top SR20DET that features some choice JDM bolt-ons like the GReddy front mount intercooler, Blitz downpipe and HKS blow-off valve, intake and exhaust. Like any good project car, Matt certainly isn't finished with this one. He's looking to pull the motor, clean it up, re-wire, and put just enough upgrades to bring him up to the 300whp mark.

Inside is relatively stock compared to the rest of the car. Matt cites this as an area that will see a bit more attention as the build progresses. For now, it has some S14 seats, a DND Interiors steering wheel, as well as Cusco e-brake and shift boots in matching purple stitching. In addition, there's is a GKTECH carbon fiber gauge pod housing a GReddy boost gauge, and a Likewise shift knob and drift button on the handbrake.

Matt's a tried and true car guy and his experience tells a story of someone who really cares about his hobby. The fact that he can build a SEMA show quality Ford truck, then turn around to build a JDM Silvia that looks straight out of Tokyo is a special kind of feat.

One of the most valuable cars Walker owned is an R34-generation Skyline GT-4 V-Spec that’s among just a handful in the United States.

Taking to YouTube, a man by the name of Craig Lieberman discusses the rare R34 GT-R that Walker used to own – and it has a very interesting history.

Lieberman was a technical advisor for the Fast & Furious franchise and introduced Walker to the GT-R. Back in the day, a handful of R34 models were imported to the U.S. by a company called MotoRex. They were kind enough to loan Walker an R34 and, before long, the actor fell in love with the car and quickly purchased one for himself.

Walker’s former R34 is a V-Spec model in Sonic Silver. Interestingly, Walker didn’t keep it for that long and decided to sell it and buy a white V-Spec II model instead. The car was then sold to a man in Hawaii who set about turning it into a replica of the R34 that MotoRex first loaned Walker, lovingly known as the ‘Blackbird.’ As such, the car was fitted with a C-West bodykit and other custom parts.

Just when you thought the story couldn’t get any more intriguing, the car was later seized from the Hawaiian owner by the DEA and sold at auction to a man in Texas. Currently, it is under the possession of a JDM importer.

Nissan Skyline R34 models won’t be legal to import into the United States until 2024, and this example is one of just 14 to have been imported new by MotoRex back in the day.

Tire-shredding to the max, Robert Anthony of Arizona's 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R is one of the dopest R32 we've featured in recent years.",10/09/2020,"Intro by Sam Du

I attended a local Southern California car meet a couple of weeks ago when I had a revelation about Nissan's third generation Skyline GT-R: they're everywhere! I legit saw more JDM R32 GT-Rs than Scions or Civics. We can credit this to the recent ruling passed a few years ago that allows any imported car 25 years or older to be exempt from National Traffic Highway Safety Administration regulations (don't forget to read our guide to importing a JDM car). Since then, it's quite common for every container sailing in from Japan to have an assortment of used and semi-abused right-hand-drive R32 Skylines, which in turn has filled the market with a healthy amount of them.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating, and I still get a little giddy every time I see one on the road. Perhaps what I'm trying to say is that since the GT-R was every JDM fanboys dream car and they're now legal and affordable to own ($32,500 can get you something really nice on BringATrailer.com), if you're going to want to standout as an R32 owner these days, then you're going to have to go above and beyond, which is exactly what Orlando Villalobos did with his 1989 Skyline GT-R.

Originally from Corpus Christi, Texas, Orlando is now a master sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Group A '80s and '90s touring cars were always his thing from playing the original Gran Turismo, so he gravitated to the all-wheel-drive GT-R over the likes of the Toyota Supra and Ford Sierra; however, it wasn't until he was much older that he would finally be able to fulfill his childhood fantasy and own one in America.

On the outside, his GT-R looks every bit like it's ready to battle on Tsukuba Circuit (interestingly, Orlando's Voltex rear wing was sourced from a retired racecar that previously put down rocket-fast lap times at Fuji Speedway). There's a laundry list of dope JDM parts that make this car very authentic; however, it's what's underneath that makes it truly special. Modern-day reliability and 500+whp performance help make this 31-year-old project car more impressive than the dated Group A racecars Orlando once envied decades ago.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

Can this RB26DETT handle more power than what it's putting down now? You bet it can. Orlando explains the engine and fuel system can withstand up to 800whp. For now, he intends to improve his driving skills and learn the car more at local track days before swapping to a larger turbo. ""I love the allure of challenging myself and racing the clock to see if I can best myself. This is a form of personal advancement and I feel we can all use a little personal accountability to become better in life where possible.""

Before I sign off, there is an untold story that Orlando wants people to know. The journey toward obtaining and building his dream car was far from easy. He's reminded every instance he gets behind the wheel to never take life for granted, and that we shouldn't either. I'll let Orlando take the stage...

LIVING A LIFE OF NO REGRETS

""In 2010 I was deployed to Afghanistan. It was a rough deployment that I had never experienced in the previous four years I had been in. I had been blown up and shot at multiple times. After I lost a mentor of mine, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Master Sergeant Daniel Fedder, I realized how fragile and short life was. I told myself I would begin living life with less regrets and that I would do things I always said I would. Owning my dream car, the Skyline GT-R (obsessed about it since the Gran Turismo days), was one of those things.

ULTIMATE FIND CLOSE TO HOME

During days back on the base, I started searching on the internet for one. Ironically, one popped up in the larger city neighboring my hometown, Corpus Christi, Texas. When I called from an iridium satellite phone, the owner and now friend, Josh ""Joshiroku"" Garcia saw the crazy number and hung up on me thinking I was just another tire kicker. Days later, my parents got in touch with him and informed him that I was indeed real and had intentions of owning the car. Josh, who also had family in the military, told my parents he would take them for a test drive and would hold the car for me until I decided I wanted it. Naturally, I did, so my parents handed him a check within that week and the car then belonged to me.

CURSED R32

It was fairly stock appearing but also had a semi-built engine and BCNR33 Brembo brakes. It also had a some very nice gold BBS LM wheels that had been acquired by someone who unfortunately had an untimely death about a week after the wheel transaction. That was when I should've known the car had a curse...

NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE

Three days after I returned from Afghanistan and started driving the car, I lost control driving at a moderately low speed while taking a very easy curve. There was no reason the car should've lost control. HICAS had been blocked out and there was no oil or debris on the road. The car tried to kill me. The car bounced around and I somehow shortly developed rod knock.

THE CURSE STRIKES AGAIN

Not long after, I received orders to move to Okinawa. The car sat while I went overseas to Okinawa, Korea, Philippines, and lived in Dubai for a year before returning back to Okinawa and eventually moving back to California in 2014. While working in Dubai, Josh Garcia, whom I purchased the car from, swapped in a BCNR33 engine and helped with some of the current aero. After getting situated in California, the car was shipped out to me; that's when the curse struck again. The enclosed trailer transport driver got a flat tire and while changing the flat on his truck, somehow the truck fell off the jack stands and crushed him to death.

FOWL PLAY

Weeks later, the car was picked up and delivered by another individual where it seldomly was driven. While preparing for yet another deployment in 2015, I trusted the car with an 'RB specialist' that I was introduced to. He was to change belts and fluids and prepare the car for a seven-month storage, but instead, he drove the car 'like he stole it' and returned it back to me with rod knock. I couldn't do much, so I stored the car and eventually nearly lost all motivation in getting it running again. It bounced from one failed shop to another and everything else in between.

BARDABE SAVES THE DAY

In 2018, I met Juan Vargas, owner of Bardabe Performance (now located in Austin, Texas) and things finally started to look up. Juan helped me with planning to achieve my goals of a safe, responsive, and overengineered car. I wanted to stabilize the car so its tail wouldn't fly out from behind it. I wanted a responsive and strong car so it wouldn't have the unfortunate rod knock again.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

In December of 2019, after waiting months for an N1 block, its single turbo conversion, all the amazing hard lines, custom fuel system, wiring harness and Leask-Spec advanced cooling system, the car was ready to break its curse. Juan was dead set on eliminating any future failures, like oil lines that usually fail on the super-hot running RBs. He was persistent to see me actually fully enjoy the car since he had seen how long it had been off the road due to other's lack of care previously.

POSITIVE FUTURE

The plan is now to retain a street tamed car that can conquer any obstacle thrown at it and with zero failures. Future goals are to upgrade to a BNR34 six-speed GETRAG transmission and updated, stronger arms and sway bars. Eventually the car will be ready for track events, but for the time being it'll remain a daily reminder of how life is too short to not enjoy, and how all 'curses' and bad luck can be overcome with the right people pushing you in the right direction."" - Orlando Villalobos

The car bounced around and I somehow shortly developed rod knock.</p><br /><br /><a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Personal-Steering-Wheel.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Personal Steering Wheel"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Personal Steering Wheel""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Personal-Steering-Wheel.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Personal Steering Wheel""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 23/23</span></a> | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (23) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>THE CURSE STRIKES AGAIN</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">Not long after, I received orders to move to Okinawa. The car sat while I went overseas to Okinawa, Korea, Philippines, and lived in Dubai for a year before returning back to Okinawa and eventually moving back to California in 2014. While working in Dubai, Josh Garcia, whom I purchased the car from, swapped in a BCNR33 engine and helped with some of the current aero. After getting situated in California, the car was shipped out to me; that's when the curse struck again. The enclosed trailer transport driver got a flat tire and while changing the flat on his truck, somehow the truck fell off the jack stands and crushed him to death.</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>FOWL PLAY</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">Weeks later, the car was picked up and delivered by another individual where it seldomly was driven. While preparing for yet another deployment in 2015, I trusted the car with an 'RB specialist' that I was introduced to. He was to change belts and fluids and prepare the car for a seven-month storage, but instead, he drove the car 'like he stole it' and returned it back to me with rod knock. I couldn't do much, so I stored the car and eventually nearly lost all motivation in getting it running again. It bounced from one failed shop to another and everything else in between.</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>BARDABE SAVES THE DAY</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">In 2018, I met Juan Vargas, owner of <a href=""https://www.bardabe.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bardabe Performance</a> (now located in Austin, Texas) and things finally started to look up. Juan helped me with planning to achieve my goals of a safe, responsive, and overengineered car. I wanted to stabilize the car so its tail wouldn't fly out from behind it. I wanted a responsive and strong car so it wouldn't have the unfortunate rod knock again.</p><br /><br /><a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-BorgWarner-S257SX-Turbo.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R BorgWarner S257SX Turbo"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R BorgWarner S257SX Turbo""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-BorgWarner-S257SX-Turbo.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R BorgWarner S257SX Turbo""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 23/23</span></a> | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (23) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text"">In December of 2019, after waiting months for an N1 block, its single turbo conversion, all the amazing hard lines, custom fuel system, wiring harness and Leask-Spec advanced cooling system, the car was ready to break its curse.

He was persistent to see me actually fully enjoy the car since he had seen how long it had been off the road due to other's lack of care previously.</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>POSITIVE FUTURE</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">The plan is now to retain a street tamed car that can conquer any obstacle thrown at it and with zero failures. Future goals are to upgrade to a BNR34 six-speed GETRAG transmission and updated, stronger arms and sway bars.

Ray Abelada was fortunate enough to get his hands on this KH2 Gunmetal model, and his train of thought on modifying it almost derails the notion that wild, in-your-face mods need to accompany Nissan's classically boxy, muscular '90s hero. Unlike many of you, Ray didn't daydream about blasting around town in Nissan's turbocharged, AWD wonder. His attention was locked into another brand entirely. ""I grew up in the late '90s era and I've always been a Honda guy,"" he states. The idea of importing and tackling this build was a result of his friend, Tony, who'd been talking about building a JDM Integra. ""I started looking for my own JDM project car. I wanted something unique and that could stand out on its own.""

JDM Driver

The unplanned search led to the hunt for a Skyline GTS-T model, and with very few options in his region, he came up short. ""Two months had passed, and I missed out on several purchases. I eventually broadened my search to include GT-Rs and accidentally found Driver Motorsports through a Google image search in January 2017."" Reaching out to Chris Driver to get more info on a GT-R they had on their website, Ray was hit with the bad news as Chris informed him the car had already been spoken for. However, it wasn't all bad—the Premium JDM importer was expecting another GT-R shortly and Ray was eager to get a look.

With a number of photos and info provided by Driver Motorsports on their incoming Skyline, Ray was sold and immediately wired a deposit to make sure he didn't miss the opportunity. Not even a week later, Ray, and his family geared up for a 3-hour drive to bring home their new family weekend car. Starting with a clean chassis is always a good idea and this R32 was in excellent shape. So impressed by the newly acquired skyline's condition and his overall experience with the transaction, Ray's extended family visited Driver Motorsports and picked up a Nissan Gloria and Laurel.

Groomed to Perfection

The only modifications done to the R32 upon Ray taking ownership were M's intake pods and a Kakimoto exhaust system. Like almost any enthusiast, regardless of brand or vehicle type, the first set of changes were based on coilovers and a set of wheels. In actuality, those wound up being the only upgrades for an entire year as he just wanted to enjoy the car as-is. Of course, with so many aftermarket options just a few keystrokes away, it's not hard to justify picking up some new parts, and Ray finally gave in, ordering a custom-spec set of Leon Hardiritt Reise wheels through Phil of RavSpec. A lengthy process being that the rollers would still have to be built and make their way back across the pond, it granted more than enough time to get ahold of some additional goods.

Rather than trying to pack on additional body panel muscle, Ray decided to highlight the coupe's natural angles with an N1 style front lip to fill out the front bumper, then capped it off with an Ab Flug carbon-fiber front diffuser. The combination is seamless and updates the Skyline's front without stepping away from its early '90s charm. A vented Seibon carbon hood finishes off the front end's mild makeover.

To streamline the sides of the GT-R, and match the flow of the front bumper's new, lower appearance, a set of Shorin carbon-fiber side skirts were sourced through RHDJapan and lead your eyes toward the Gracer/Trust rear bumper spats that, in conjunction with the factory rear quarter panel lines, help encapsulate the rear. Other additions include sleek GKTEch side mirrors and atop the trunk you'll spot a factory spoiler that's been topped with a Fujimura carbon gurney flap. To tie everything together, the 19x10 +20 Leon Hardiritt wheels arrived and were wrapped in 255/35s and offer a gunmetal face to match the Skyline's body and a polished lip to offset the look.

As much as we like the outside look of this build, the interior might be one of its best attributes. The dash panels confirm that Driver Motorsports imports some immaculate cars, as the surfaces look picture perfect. Enhancing the look and adding Ray's touch included a set of Recaro Wildcats and matching door panel inserts that play nicely with the red laced Momo wheel and restitched shift and e-brake boots.

More Power on the Horizon

By now you've grown accustomed to seeing 700-plus hp Skylines with huge single turbo conversions and so have we, but in Ray's case, he's eased himself into the power production part of the build. The factory turbos were rebuilt using steel blades and a Mine's equal-length downpipe was bolted on in addition to a set of Tomei dump tubes with the brand's titanium test pipe and exhaust. More fuel is provided by FIC 750s and a Walbro pump and in the hands of Driver Motorsports, the Haltech Platinum Pro brings power up to 373hp safely and reliably.

Those numbers certainly aren't here to stay, and Ray fully expects to outgrow that power output as a pair of GT2860s at home can attest. He notes, ""I didn't want to run them on the stock bottom end and oil pump. I figure the safest way is to pull the motor and upgrade to forged internals, then install the GT2860's and get it retuned.""","<div><p class=""article-text"">Cars like this 1990 R32 <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/"">Nissan</a> Skyline GT-R don't come along very often.

The Nissan LEAF has won various accolades around the world including World Car of the Year 2011, Car of the Year 2011 in Europe, and Car of the Year Japan in 2011 and 2012. Among safety, control and comfort features, the electric car features ProPILOT – a “hands-on, eyes-on"" system that allows the car to stop, restart and stay centered in its lane and e-Pedal technology for one-pedal driving.

Nissan says that the LEAF EV owners have driven more than 14.8 billion clean-air kilometers since 2010 and have collectively helped prevent more than 2.4 billion kilograms of CO2 emissions.

A prototype version of the new Nissan Z will debut September 15.

The new Nissan Z's design will take inspiration from its predecessors, if this new teaser video is any indication. It draws a clear line between the original 240Z and the new model's headlight shape, while also showing the taillights that are clearly a nod to the legendary 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Nissan

We can also see the silhouette of the Z, which Nissan has teased before, and the car's new badge that's on the rear flank of the car. It appears to have a similar shape as the current model, but the details should make it look far more modern than the 370Z, which arrived way back in 2009.



We expect the new Z to be called 400Z and be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine. It'll retain the classic front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and will hopefully come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. (If it doesn't, we'll be disappointed.) The so-called ""Z Proto"" that debuts September 15 will likely be similar to the eventual production model that should arrive later this year before going on sale sometime in 2021.

Continua a mietere successi e record, la Nissan Leaf. L’auto full electric del produttore giapponese, capace di aggiudicarsi diversi premi e riconoscimenti in tutto il mondo (come lo “European Car of the Year” e il “World Car of the Year” nel 2011 e il “Car of the Year Japan” nel 2011-2012) taglia un traguardo storico per il mondo della mobilità alternativa.

La Leaf ha infatti raggiunto e superato il traguardo dei 500 mila modelli prodotti e consegnati a clienti in tutto il mondo, dimostrando così che il progetto nato e sviluppato 10 anni fa nel Paese del Sol Levante era destinato al successo. La vettura numero mezzo milione è stata assemblata nel sito produttivo di Sunderland, nel cuore del Regno Unito, dove la casa costruttrice giapponese ha realizzato circa 175 mila modelli della Nissan Leaf. Di questi, 5.700 circolano quotidianamente in Italia. Nel nostro Paese, poi, è possibile acquistare anche la versione Nissan Leaf e+, che garantisce una maggiore autonomia grazie alla batteria potenziata.

A ricevere il veicolo è stata un’ignara coppia di coniugi norvegesi. “Mio marito ed io abbiamo scelto di acquistare Nissan LEAF nel 2018 – ha commentato Maria Jansen, proprietari della Leaf numero 500 mila – ed è stato amore a prima vista. Siamo molto fieri di avere la 500 millesima Leaf prodotta perché grazie alla maggiore autonomia e alle tecnologie avanzate, soddisfa pienamente le nostre esigenze”.

Nonostante i due coniugi abbiano deciso di acquistare la loro auto elettrica nel 2018, la consegna è avvenuta solo qualche tempo dopo. In una data, però, tutt’altro che casuale: la Nissan Leaf numero 500 mila è arrivata a casa della coppia norvegese lo scorso 9 settembre, data nella quale si celebra il World EV Day, ossia la giornata mondiale dedicata ai veicoli a trazione completamente elettrica (l’acronimo “EV”, per i pochi che non lo sapessero, sta proprio per “Electric Vehicle”).

Diverse le tecnologie che, in questi 10 anni, hanno contribuito al successo dell’auto elettrica giapponese. Il sistema e-Pedal, ad esempio, permette di guidare con il solo pedale dell’acceleratore e migliorare in maniera sensibile le prestazioni del sistema di recupero dell’energia in frenata. Il ProPILOT, invece, unisce diversi sistemi di assistenza alla guida che assistono il conducente in fase di sterzata, accelerazione e frenata.

Infine, il produttore del Paese del Sol Levante sta implementando anche in Italia la rete proprietaria di colonnine Fast Charge, che consentono di ricaricare in fretta la batteria della Leaf. Facendo il “pieno” in una delle stazioni di ricarica Nissan, è possibile ricaricare la batteria dal 20% al 60% in appena un’ora.","<div><p class=""hatom-extra""><br />editato in:  <br />da  <br /></p><p>Continua a mietere successi e record, la <strong>Nissan Leaf</strong>.

The milestone Leaf was produced at the automaker's Sunderland, England, factory in August, but Nissan held off on announcing it until Wednesday to coincide with World EV Day.

The car will go to an owner in Norway—Maria Jansen.

""My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it,"" Jansen said in a statement. ""We're very excited to become the proud owners of the 500,000th Nissan Leaf. This car really meets our needs with extended range and enhanced technologies.""

Nissan launched the first-generation Leaf in December 2010, making it the first mass-market all-electric car to go on sale. The current, second-generation, Leaf was introduced for the 2018 model year.

While 500,000 electric cars is a noteworthy achievement, it's taken Nissan much longer to reach that goal than originally expected. And it's not the first EV to get there; the Tesla Model 3 passed that mark earlier this year.

the 500,000th Nissan Leaf and owner Maria Jansen

Nissan originally targeted the production of 500,000 EVs by 2012, including the Leaf and other cars using its companion AESC battery technology. Including sales in China, it would have been even more.

Other electric models have been slow to materialize. Nissan sells the e-NV200 electric van in certain markets, and plans to launch the Ariya crossover as a 2022 model. An EV for Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand is expected as well.

It's been less than a year and a half since the Leaf crossed 400,000 sales, though, and that's a testament to the model's extensive refresh for 2018. Sales have picked up in some of the Leaf's global markets—like Europe, where it was the top-selling EV for the 2018 calendar year.

But in the United States and elsewhere, the Tesla Model 3 has taken the lead in EV sales most months.

Meanwhile, Nissan's production in Smyrna has made Tennessee one of the hotbeds for EV production in the U.S. Volkswagen is now planning to bring ID.4 production to its Chattanooga factory in 2022.

Let's not forget the name—Leaf has a powerful meaning referring to how in choosing an EV we're choosing cleaner air. Sales figures aside, let's not lose sight of it and the change it's brought about.","<div><p>Nearly a decade after the model was launched, Nissan has reported that it's produced more than 500,000 Leaf electric cars.</p><br /><p>The milestone Leaf was produced at the automaker's Sunderland, England, factory in August, but Nissan held off on announcing it until Wednesday to coincide with World EV Day.</p><p class=""nativo-article-slot""></p><br /><p>The car will go to an owner in Norway&#8212;Maria Jansen.</p><br /><p>""My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it,"" Jansen said in a statement.

I remember attending the launch of the original Juke – it was a revolutionary concept and created a completely new sector of the motoring market.
Our Puma vs Captur vs Juke group test placed the Juke third out of, um, three.

Not because the Juke isn’t a good car, but simply because it has to fight on so many fronts.",14/09/2020,"That’s all folks. Time for the Juke to leave us for pastures new. It’s been with us for six months, covered many thousands of miles and been driven by half the team. When it arrived, we were tasked with answering a tricky question: could it reclaim its crown? Tricky.

I remember attending the launch of the original Juke – it was a revolutionary concept and created a completely new sector of the motoring market. Since then, though, many other car manufacturers have caught on to the baby crossover concept and the segment has become crowded with alternatives to the car that started it all.

So, where the Juke was sitting pretty on the top of the pile back in the day, we wanted to see if – with so much choice now – the Nissan has slipped down the pecking order.

Our Puma vs Captur vs Juke group test placed the Juke third out of, um, three. Which rather suggests that Nissan has a bit to do to catch up with its nearest rivals. However, I have been accosted many times by potential new Juke buyers in supermarket car parks. They all already have a Juke and want to upgrade to the newer model – none of them especially wants to go to another carmaker. So, to those people, I say, you will love it. It’s more spacious than the original and has a much better design.

It’s frugal and easy to manoeuvre. But, as to whether it can reclaim its crown… well, the answer to that is likely, no. Not because the Juke isn’t a good car, but simply because it has to fight on so many fronts. It’s been reliable, economical, spacious enough… OK, some don’t like its style, but at least it stands out from the crowd.

This little crossover managed a long and arduous M1/M25/London commute just as well as it nipped through country lanes. So, through it may not have reclaimed its crown, to me it’s still royally good.","<div><p>That&#8217;s all folks. Time for the Juke to leave us for pastures new.

So I created the ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Upgrades / 3rd Party / Aftermarket / EV’ Group on Facebook.
The number one term that people searched for was ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Replacement’ and that's why I chose that name.
I also own ‘Nissan LEAF battery Installers.’”Cameli bought the domain on August 17, 2020, and the site went live on August 26, 2020.
That shows the potential aftermarket companies dedicated to keeping electric cars running may become a fantastic business opportunity.",15/09/2020,"Real heroes can be regular people, such as Sal Cameli. He goes through a lot to support electric car adoption. The video above shows the process Cameli adopts to be able to charge his Nissan Leaf. His other heroic act in helping get more people into EVs is a world map he has created to help other Leaf owners to replace the batteries in their cars. And you can help him make it even better.

Cameli came up with the idea of creating NissanLeafBatteryReplacement.com to help Leaf owner back in February 2018, as he told InsideEVs:

“Back then, I heard of a company named MUXSAN. They were swapping out LEAF battery packs and I figured it would be good to have a Facebook group to discuss this with other LEAF owners. So I created the ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Upgrades / 3rd Party / Aftermarket / EV’ Group on Facebook. On that group, I started a pinned post with a listing of aftermarket LEAF Battery Mechanics on January 28, 2020, and the list grew to 18 installers & suppliers until August of this year.”

That was when people that were not on Facebook started to ask Cameli for help.

“That's why I figured it was time to create a website. The number one term that people searched for was ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Replacement’ and that's why I chose that name. I also own ‘Nissan LEAF battery Installers.’”

Cameli bought the domain on August 17, 2020, and the site went live on August 26, 2020. The idea to make it a global repository came precisely from MUXSAN, which is in the Netherlands.

Ever since InsideEVs wrote about the EV Rides service of replacing Leaf battery packs, we have been receiving requests from other companies all over the world that also perform this sort of service. Cameli came to their rescue, as you can see below.

Speaking about his experience with the car in the video above, Cameli bought his brand new Nissan Leaf SL on April 20, 2013.

“It has 82,000 miles and I have lost 6 bars. I can drive 35 miles now at 40 mph, and around 30 at 60 mph. A couple of months ago, I had to drive to a client who was 157 miles round trip. The total drive took me 11.5 hours because I had to charge five times.”

This is the sort of sacrifice we hope he does not have to do for much longer when he gets a new battery pack for his Nissan. For what he told us, his car is in much need of that.

It is vital to notice Cameli is just listing the companies that perform these services. Their prices and even the quality of their services is beyond his control. That said, make sure these companies have good reputations and ask them about their fees before closing any deal. The more companies available, the better.

You can help Cameli and other used EV cars find these companies close to their homes by informing the map creator of the ones that perform the same services EV Rides and MUXSAN do. Whether you own the place or is just aware of any such businesses, get in touch with him through sal@electricsal.com and tell him about any battery pack replacement company you are aware of.

When Cameli started his website, he had 18 locations. His map now has 29 battery pack replacement businesses, and we suspect this article will help that increase a lot more. That shows the potential aftermarket companies dedicated to keeping electric cars running may become a fantastic business opportunity. We’re glad that we are finally discussing these aftermarket battery packs, but we should discuss them even more. Help save used EVs!

The charges being heard at Tokyo District Court center around Kelly’s alleged role in failing to report to Japanese authorities the future compensation of Ghosn, who led Nissan Motor Co. 7201, -1.63% for two decades.

Kelly pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Japanese prosecutors outlined allegations of what they said was a complex and clandestine scheme to pay former star executive Carlos Ghosn. Kelly denied the allegations and said everything that was done was intended to keep Ghosn, an “extraordinary executive,” at Nissan.

Ghosn was also arrested and charged two years ago but jumped bail while awaiting trial and fled to Lebanon late last year.

Kelly, who turned 64 on Tuesday, appeared in court before a panel of three judges headed by presiding Kenji Shimotsu.

Nissan as a company is also facing the same charges in the trial with Kelly. It has acknowledged guilt and is paying a 2.4 billion yen ($22.6 million) fine.

Its representative at the trial said the company would not contest the charges.

Ghosn has vigorously defended himself, saying he is innocent. The defense has argued Ghosn’s compensation was never agreed upon, let alone paid.

The rear end is heavily disguised, but it appears pretty evolutionary. However, the model appears to adopt slimmer taillights and a wider third brake light.

Bigger changes occur inside as the cabin is far more modern and high-tech than its predecessor. While the steering wheels looks pretty familiar, there’s a new digital instrument and a free-standing infotainment system. We can also see new climate controls and what appears to be a push-button shifter.

Specifications remain a mystery, but the crossover is slated to ride on the CMF-C/D platform and be offered with an assortment of turbocharged petrol engines. The diesel engines will reportedly be dropped, but there could be eco-friendly alternatives in the form of plug-in hybrid and range-extended EV options.

Nissan hasn’t said much about the Qashqai, but recent reports have suggested the crossover has been delayed until mid-2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. That remains unconfirmed, but the company said they’ll have more to share in the coming months.

Of course, we can also expect the crossover to arrive stateside as the next-generation Rogue Sport.

Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.

Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.

In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""

The spokesman said other models would continue to meet the needs of local consumers.

Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.

The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.

Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.

The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.

Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.

The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres. The X-Trail is a sport utility vehicle with a minimal 2.0-litre engine. The Sylphy is a compact car with a 1.6-litre engine.

Upon learning of the reported discontinuation, a Nissan Teana owner who asked not to be named said his family has three Nissan cars, two of which are Teanas. They have proved to be comfortable vehicles, but the family has become worried about resale prices.

Pisit Rangsaritwutikul, president of the Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) under the Industry Ministry, said a change in production lines among car makers during the economic recession caused by the pandemic's impact is normal. They need to adjust themselves to markets in each country.

""I'm not shocked by the news reports,"" Mr Pisit said. ""The parent company will have already carefully considered what car models will be produced to satisfy motorists in different countries.""

Mr Pisit said the Thai market has potential for electric vehicles and companies probably see an opportunity for new business directions.

Nissan's decision reflects its plan to adjust car manufacturing in Thailand by moving towards new-generation cars, following a talk with officials at the Industry Ministry.

Nissan is ""confident"" in Thailand, where it plans to continue its business, Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said in an earlier interview after a recent talk with Ramesh Narasimhan, the president of Nissan Motor Thailand.

Nissan is determined to produce both electric and hybrid cars in the long term and has already won support from the Board of Investment through its incentive programmes, Mr Suriya said.

The company's Yokohama-based headquarters announced in May that Nissan's Indonesian plant would be closed as part of a four-year plan to improve business performance.

The closure would make Thailand Nissan's sole production base in Southeast Asia.","<div><p class=""article-headline""><br /><h2><br />Nissan mum on discontinuation report</h2><br /></p><br /><img src=""https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2020/09/09/3743419.jpg"" alt=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)"" title=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)""><br /><br /><br />Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)<br /><br /><p>Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.</p><p>Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.</p>&#13;<br /><p>In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""</p>&#13;<br /><p>The spokesman said other models would&#160;continue to meet the needs of local consumers.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Read: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn gone, American Kelly faces Japan trial alone

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.","<div><p>&#160;The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.</p><p>Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.</p><p>And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.</p><p><strong>Read:&#160;<a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/nissans-carlos-ghosn-gone-american-kelly-faces-japan-trial-alone-882325.html"" target=""_blank"">Nissan's Carlos Ghosn gone, American Kelly faces Japan trial alone</a></strong></p><p>The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.</p><p>Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing.

But alas, the same company that brought us some of the most insane performance cars from the nineties has pulled through on its promise to deliver yet another Z car, and this thing is shaping up to be awesome.

Dubbed the 'Proto Z', we already know that it's going to take styling inspiration from the older Fairladies such as the 240Z and the 300ZX, but feature modern tech that makes it competitive with Toyota's revived Supra.

Just last night, Nissan dropped a teaser for the Proto Z that not only revealed what the car's engine will sound like, but confirmed that the 400Z will be available with a manual transmission. Oh, and a manual handbrake if you're interested.

This is a massive move for the enthusiasts on Nissan's part, and is also somewhat of a dig at Toyota, as a manual transmission isn't currently offered on the BMW-built Supra.

A few more details are revealed in the short clip, such as the 'Z' emblems on the door sills, wide alloy wheels, and a pair of LED headlights.

When it comes to the engine, it's no surprise to hear that familiar V6 tone, except this one will come with a pair of turbochargers. Reports state that Nissan is using a 3.0-litre Infiniti engine that is shared with the Q50 and Q60 Red Sport.

This boosted mill reported pumps out a healthy 298kW and 475Nm of torque, but exact figures of the Proto Z are still unknown.

155,155,155,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Nissan-s-record-loan-guarantee-spotlights-lack-of-transparency,Nissan's record loan guarantee spotlights lack of transparency,"TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record 130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.
Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic.
The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.
The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.
The JFC's loan guarantees, which will be covered by taxpayer funds if the loans go sour, are the last line of defense in terms of corporate support.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record 130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.

The Development Bank of Japan extended over 1.88 trillion yen in crisis response loans between March and July as the virus damaged the national and global economy. Nissan is the only major corporation covered by guarantees from the state-backed Japan Finance Corp.

But other large companies could receive bailouts similar to Nissan's if the coronavirus crisis persists. Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic. Japan's three megabanks granted 1.2 trillion yen in financing to Toyota Motor alone.

""We've accepted almost all loan requests from the first wave of applications, but second helpings [of additional financing] will be tough,"" said an executive at a megabank. Considering demand is not expected to recover amid the pandemic, the extra financing risks becoming toxic debt.

Banks already were limited in how much they can loan to each company or group based on the need to keep their financial institution sound. The Financial Stability Board, an international body made up of financial watchdogs, reportedly has shifted from encouraging loans that keep companies afloat to debating how to maintain the health of banking institutions.

If private lenders approach their limits, then public-sector institutions like the Development Bank of Japan will start filling the gap.

The DBJ approves a crisis response loan if it deems the company to have a sufficiently large impact on livelihoods and Japan's economy. Job creation and a wide base of subcontractors are two factors in the approval process. Normally, the DBJ assumes the risk if the debt cannot be recovered.

The bank decided to lend Nissan a total of 180 billion yen in May. Japan was under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Automobile production was at a virtual standstill, and vehicle purchases had plummeted.

Nissan employs 140,000 people groupwide, and the blow would be even larger if subcontractors are counted. The DBJ also apparently considered that private-sector banks' efforts to provide assistance would be harmed if Nissan did not receive financial support.

The loan to Nissan is funded through the Japan Finance Corp. The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.

A JFC loan guarantee is not unusual under the crisis response system. Individual recipients of the guarantees are not expected to be disclosed since that could affect the company's credit rating. The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.

A Nissan spokesman says the automaker is ""completely unaware"" of the government guarantee.

In addition to the program's lack of transparency, there is the issue of ensuring managerial discipline of companies receiving such guarantees. In 2010, Japan Airlines received 350 billion yen in public funds, along with government-guaranteed financing. At the time, the distressed carrier faced withering scrutiny over its business practices. Nissan's situation has not deteriorated to that extent.

This video offers a deep dive into the car's history from someone who knows it inside and out. Craig Lieberman was a technical advisor for the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, and helped introduce Walker to the GT-R.

An R32 GT-R at a ""Fast and Furious"" car casting call piqued Walker's interest, Lieberman said, so he took the actor to MotoRex, a company that was importing and federalizing GT-Rs at the time (this was before the model was officially launched in the United States with the R35 generation). MotoRex then loaned Walker an R34—nicknamed ""Blackbird""—for an extended test drive.

After the test drive, Walker purchased the car featured in this video. It's a 1999 V-Spec model painted in Sonic Silver. V-Spec models got a few performance upgrades over the base GT-R, including an active limited-slip differential and stiffer suspension. However, it was soon surpassed by the V-Spec II, and later by the even more hardcore M-Spec and Nismo Z-Tune models.

Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec

Walker later traded the silver V-Spec for a white V-Spec II, according to Lieberman. The silver car was sold to an owner in Hawaii. Intending to make the car into a replica of the MotoRex Blackbird (while retaining the silver color), he installed a C-West bodykit, as well as a carbon-fiber hood and some other performance parts.

The car was later seized from its Hawaiian owner by the DEA as part of an asset-forfeiture ruling, and sold at auction. It went to an owner in Texas, who kept it for about 15 years, Lieberman said. It was sold earlier this year to JDM importer Toprank. The R34 is one of only 14 federalized Skyline GT-Rs imported by MotoRex (other R34 Skylines won't be legal to import until 2024 under the 25-year-rule), according to Lieberman. That, along with the connection to Paul Walker, means this car is likely worth about $400,000, he said.

It's also worth noting that this car is not the R34 GT-R Walker drove in ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" They aren't even the same shade of silver (the movie car was painted in a non-factory hue from U.S. firm House of Kolor). That was actually Lieberman's own personal car.

Pros and Cons Pros SR20 is a dream, Manual makes this car heaps of fun Cons Beware of anyonr with a screwdriver, Over 500 stolen in 2019

- shares





After having my Pulsar Plus stolen while I was at work one day, there was a N15 shaped hole in my heart. But after a few months a British Racing Green (as I like to call it) SSS showed up on Facebook marketplace. Not knowing how to drive manual yet, I had the seller drive me around the hills. I was happy with what I saw and $1200 bucks later I had a car that my friend drove home for me. The SR20 engine squeezed into that engine bay was an awesome thing. It had decent low-down torque, yet it could rev out to the stars. From memory it was up over 8000rpm. The aftermarket muffler had it sounding pretty neat for a 4-cylinder. A fuel economy of around 8 litres per 100 kilometres was the usual for my suburban mix.

Driving in traffic was a little annoying as first gear was locked out until you were at walking pace, but torque in 2nd gear would get you through. Travelling at 100km/h had the engine at 3000rpm, which was a bit loud for listening to podcasts, but not enough to put you off road trips. This meant you could shift 1-2-5 onto the freeway, using all of 2nd gear to get up to speed. Shifting through the five speeds added to the joy, with a longish throw that added to the fun of rowing into each notchy gear. Having driven a 2nd-Gen Mazda 3 shortly after, I much preferred shifting with my arm than just my wrist.

Me and the boys had some fun trying to find a clutch fluid reservoir on this cable clutch system. The pedal wasn't heavy, but wasn't overly communicative either. I had bought this car with what looked like King Low springs already installed. The ""metro bus seat material"" trimmed sports seats held you in well, as it cornered very flat through the hills. The Pulsar did have the tendency to oversteer at the limit, and felt disinterested in any forms of lift-off fun. The steering wheel was on the smaller side, making the rack feel faster, which felt great.

Cupholders were nowhere to be seen, much like in most cars of this era. The rear seats could fold almost flat when pushed down, or could become level when folding forward the rear seat base into the rear seat footwell - perfect for drive-in cinemas. The mirrors were tiny, but visibility was still excellent when looking over your shoulders. That, coupled with an awesome turning circle, made parallel parking a joy instead of a chore. Speakers in the front doors and rear parcel shelf meant you could pump some decent sound with some cheap speakers and a deck. If you are looking to dip your toes into some club racing, this was another area where this car shines. Once I bought this car, I had raced a few hillclimb events, as it was a car I didn't mind if I crashed. I could always replace it. It did a pretty good job in the ""2000cc and under category"", and was a blast to drive at eleven-tenths.

Unfortunately, immobilizers weren't standard fit on the N15 Pulsars, meaning that if you're only using a club lock at work and the shops (and not just at home), you may end up in a situation like I was, with bags packed and ready for a weekend in Marysville but with no car to put them in. My SSS was never seen again after December 27th, 2019. It was my second N15 stolen. Only an insane person would get a third one. It doesn't stop my friends sending me listings and it hasn't stopped me from toying with the idea. MORE: Nissan Pulsar news and reviews

Today, Nissan has confirmed in a YouTube video that it will feature a manual transmission.

The video pans sideways to a manual gear lever, then the driver slots it into first gear. So there you have it! The next-gen Z will definitely come with a manual transmission, which, in case you were missing the theme here, is a great thing. It also has a manual emergency brake, a feature slowly (and sadly) being replaced by electric parking brakes in other models.

Nissan threw us a few more bones in this latest teaser. For one, we can hear the engine as it revs away in the video. It sounds like a V6, and our ears are also picking up on it being turbocharged. The intel we gained at the beginning of this year suggests both those assumptions are true, as sources revealed to us that the next-gen Z would feature a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6. Those same sources also suggested it’d be offered with a manual transmission and feature retro styling, both of which appear to be on the table.

Some design elements are teased, too. We get to see where Nissan has stuck a few Z badges. Locations include the sill plates, behind the gear lever and on the brake calipers. The intriguing lights have already been shown, but we’re still digging the retro vibes they suggest.

To see the full reveal, tune in on September 15 at 8:30 p.m. ET. And watch out in the meantime, because we wouldn’t be surprised if Nissan has another teaser or two left to drop on us before next week.

Nissan has built up the anticipation for the new sports car with several teasers, including ones that revealed the Z could have a manual transmission.

While Nissan has held off on sharing many other details, we speculate that the Z Proto will be powered by the engine found in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport, a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6. That powerplant will churn out either 300 or 400 horsepower—it differs based on which Infiniti it sits in—and we aren't sure which one will be in the Z Proto. We'll tell you much more once the prototype is revealed on Tuesday.

As we revealed earlier this month, Mazda switched sourcing the CX-30 from Thailand to Japan beginning from July production in a move designed to shield the small SUV range from fluctuating currency issues.
For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.
Mazda’s decision to include a manual gearbox model in the CX-30 makes it a rarity among small SUVs, since – out of over 20 models – only a handful follow suit.
These include the Mitsubishi ASX ES (from $23,990), Nissan Qashqai ST (from $28,290), Suzuki Vitara (from $22,990), Skoda Kamiq 85TSI (from $26,990) and Fiat 500X Pop (from $24,990).",15/09/2020,"The strong-selling Mazda CX-30 for 2021 kicks off from a lower price point than before, thanks to an expanded model line-up that now includes a manual transmission option for the first time.

With stock arriving in dealers this month, the CX-30 is now expected to start from $28,990 before on-road costs, meaning that the base Pure grade with a six-speed manual gearbox would represent a $1000 saving over the six-speed automatic alternative with the same G20 2.0-litre four-cylinder front-wheel-drive configuration.

The manual gearbox will not be available on any other grade above Pure, leaving the rest of the range (G20 FWD in Evolve, Touring and Astina, G25 FWD in Touring and Astina, all-wheel-drive G25 Touring, Astina, and X20 Astina 2.0-litre supercharged compression-ignition engined models) as auto-only propositions.

For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.

Along with a lower starting price, the G20 Pure manual brings slightly different fuel consumption figures; while its published 6.5 litres per 100km on the combined cycle is the same as the G20 auto equivalent, it uses 0.2L/100km less petrol on the extra urban cycle but 0.3L/100km more in the city cycle.

The car has flared wheel arches with plastic cladding and tail lamp clusters that appear to have been inspired by those on the Renault Triber. The SUV also has a tiny quarter glass on the C-pillar.

The Nissan Magnite will be based on the CMF-A+ platform. It is the same architecture on which the Renault Triber is based. The SUV could be powered by a 1.0-litre, turbocharged petrol engine, while lower variants might get a naturally aspirated 1.0-litre unit.

Fuel Economy: 8/10AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving.
But the Qashqai doesn’t plod about either.
Unfortunately, there are no ventilated seats, and Nissan doesn’t offer heated rear seats in this vehicle.
It’s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class.",08/09/2020,"Small crossovers have been getting better and better these days, with their fair share of features and creature comforts. While the 2020 Nissan Qashqai has seemingly been outdone by newer competitors, the automaker has done quite a lot to ensure it isn’t left behind.

Power: 7/10

A few crossovers in this class offer impressive power figures, and unfortunately the Qashqai isn’t among them. Under the hood is a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with peak output rated at 141 hp at and 147 lb-ft of torque. This motor is paired to a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which works well in most conditions. The engine doesn’t feel particularly gutsy, as it just buzzes along. Unfortunately, the CVT can’t work any miracles either, and it pegs the revs at max tilt trying its best to eke out as much momentum as possible, but the Qashqai doesn’t speed up in any particular hurry.

There are a few drive modes to help customize the experience on the road, but only one truly stands out: an all-wheel-drive (AWD) lock function. In normal operation, the AWD system in the Qashqai varies the power split between the front and rear wheels, and generally it prefers the ones in the front to improve fuel consumption. However, the AWD lock mode in the Qashqai sets up a locked split ratio, ensuring all four wheels are getting power. This is mainly used at low speeds in rough terrain and will be a handy feature when the snow begins to pile up.

Fuel Economy: 8/10

AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving. This makes the Nissan slightly less efficient than rivals like the Subaru Crosstrek, and slightly more efficient than the Hyundai Kona. It’s not, however, the worst in the segment, with the Jeep Compass rated 1.0 L/100 km more combined.

Driving Feel: 6/10

Firing up the Qashqai and setting off, you don’t get the same eagerness or enthusiasm found in other vehicles in the Nissan range like the smaller Kicks. But the Qashqai doesn’t plod about either. It offers a simple driving experience – one that doesn’t feel engaging, nor is it carefree. Throttle response isn’t extremely energetic, and the light steering feel doesn’t inspire much confidence. While the suspension and ride aren’t too vague, if you push for speed on an on-ramp, you’ll be greeted with a lot of body roll. In these ways the Qashqai pales in comparison to the more responsive and engaging driving dynamics of the Crosstrek and Kona. The Qashqai excels when gently cruising on the highway, as the superb driver assistance features can do the heavy lifting.

Styling: 6/10

Nissan has a mixed design language. Some of the brand’s smaller or more affordable models, like the Kicks and Sentra, have delivered some nice styling without breaking the budget. Their bigger vehicles, like the Murano and Maxima, look elegant and premium. Unfortunately, the Qashqai has a slightly dated design that doesn’t fit in either of these two camps. While the overall design is bland, there are a few details that are worth highlighting, like the wheel design, integrated turn signals in the mirrors, and the LED light signature up front.

Inside, the Qashqai has a clean design but is missing playful details. That is becoming less forgivable, as other vehicles in this class are getting clever touches like contrasting stitched leather in the upholstery. Top trim models can be equipped with different shades of leather, and a bit of a quilted pattern to show off some level of craftsmanship, but it’s a shame to hide it away on the most expensive models.

User Friendliness: 7.5/10

Furthermore, there are a few missteps with the ergonomics and usability inside the Qashqai that are pretty frustrating. For starters, there is a bank of useful buttons hidden below the driver’s side of the dash. The heated steering wheel controls, steering assistance, and drive modes are all difficult to see and reach. Furthermore, while the infotainment system has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, the USB port to connect your phone is located in a space that is too small for modern smartphones.

However, Nissan should get credit for making its driver assistance features easy to use and understand. A bright blue button on the steering wheel enables the ProPILOT Assist function, and a clear and legible display in the gauge cluster shows what functions are working. It even shows what the car detects with its various sensors, like the car ahead, or the lane markings. Whenever it struggles to pick up one of these items, it provides a soft beep, rather than a harsh warning, as a reminder to the driver to stay vigilant.

Features: 7/10

Qashqai buyers can expect the usual suspects in terms of features and technology. Base models come with heated seats and a few safety features including blind-spot monitoring and high-beam assist. All models come with a seven-inch colour infotainment system, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

You’ll find features like dual-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel, as well as a sunroof, on the SV model – the next step up in the trim levels. Beyond the SV is the SL, which adds features like leather upholstery, a 360-degree camera, bigger wheels, and the ProPILOT Assist driver assistance and safety suite. The SL Platinum gets an upgraded Bose sound system, LED lighting, and a memory function for the driver seat.

Unfortunately, there are no ventilated seats, and Nissan doesn’t offer heated rear seats in this vehicle.

Safety: 8/10

When it comes to safety and driver assistance features, the Qashqai over-delivers. I’m so impressed with the ProPILOT Assist functionality and refinement, which is clearly among the best in the industry, let alone the segment. Only the Crosstrek with its EyeSight suite of driver assistance features is as comprehensive as the Qashqai, and I felt that the Nissan implementation of adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping was more measured and trustworthy; the way it communicates how each component is working is also an advantage.

The Qashqai performed well in crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) but doesn’t yet qualify for an award since its crash avoidance features haven’t been tested.

Comfort: 7/10

In terms of ride comfort, the only significant note is that the 19-inch wheels on my SL trim tester were noticeable on rough roads. Otherwise, the ride is comfortable enough for the commute. When it comes to the seats, they’re nothing special, but they get the job done. Other Nissan models, including the new Sentra, feature very nicely sculpted and supportive front seats that the automaker claims are inspired by NASA, but the Qashqai is left behind. It’s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class. As large as they are, the rear seats are a little less comfortable than the front seats, with a seating position and angle that may be awkward for adults.

Fortunately, there is a heated steering wheel, two-stage heated front seats, and dual-zone climate control. While the interior isn’t especially small, a bigger sunroof would help bring more sunlight into the cabin, which is always nice.

Practicality: 8/10

There’s a slight difference in cargo space depending on whether it’s equipped with a sunroof or not. Base models of the Qashqai offer 648 L in the cargo area with the rear seats in place, while folding those rear seats brings the total to around 1,730 L. If you get a higher trim model with the sunroof you’ll find 566 L with the seats up and 1,500 L with them folded. This makes the Qashqai more spacious than the Kona but it’s ever-so-slightly behind the Crosstrek.

With the seats folded, the loading surface is relatively flat. One unique addition to the Qashqai is the available cargo divider, which can help stash items in the cargo area or make a barrier to prevent things from rolling around.

Value: 7/10

The Qashqai has a wide range of trim levels, starting at a reasonable $21,598 for a front-wheel-drive S model with a manual transmission. Getting a CVT in this configuration will bump the price up to $24,298, while adding AWD will increase the price to $26,298. The next step up in the models is the SV trim, which is also available with front-wheel drive for $26,898, or $28,898 for an AWD model. The SL and SL Platinum models come standard with AWD and are priced at $31,948 and $34,098, respectively. These prices don’t include the destination fee and handling, which is $1,950.

Only the top two trim levels come with ProPILOT Assist, which is the Qashqai’s best feature. It’s easy to recommend these models, but spending over $30,000 on a subcompact crossover isn’t an easy call considering slightly larger models can be found around the same price. For example, the top trims of compact crossovers like the Subaru Forester and Nissan Rogue are priced below $40,000.

The Verdict

With so many excellent subcompact crossovers on the market, it isn’t easy for a newly refreshed model like the Qashqai to make its mark. It’s hard to compete with the likes of the Hyundai Kona and Subaru Crosstrek, but this Nissan offering fills in a few of the gaps left by those vehicles. Thanks to its impressive driver assistance features and spacious interior, it manages to stay afloat in this burgeoning segment.

Holding its own

9/8/2020 6:30:00 AM

9/8/2020 6:30:00 AM","<div><p>Small crossovers have been getting better and better these days, with their fair share of features and creature comforts. While the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/research/nissan/qashqai/2020/"">2020 Nissan Qashqai</a> has seemingly been outdone by newer competitors, the automaker has done quite a lot to ensure it isn&#8217;t left behind.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Power: 7/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>A few crossovers in this class offer impressive power figures, and unfortunately the Qashqai isn&#8217;t among them. Under the hood is a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with peak output rated at 141 hp at and 147 lb-ft of torque. This motor is paired to a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which works well in most conditions. The engine doesn&#8217;t feel particularly gutsy, as it just buzzes along. Unfortunately, the CVT can&#8217;t work any miracles either, and it pegs the revs at max tilt trying its best to eke out as much momentum as possible, but the Qashqai doesn&#8217;t speed up in any particular hurry.</p>&#13;<br /><p>There are a few drive modes to help customize the experience on the road, but only one truly stands out: an all-wheel-drive (AWD) lock function. In normal operation, the AWD system in the Qashqai varies the power split between the front and rear wheels, and generally it prefers the ones in the front to improve fuel consumption. However, the AWD lock mode in the Qashqai sets up a locked split ratio, ensuring all four wheels are getting power. This is mainly used at low speeds in rough terrain and will be a handy feature when the snow begins to pile up.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Fuel Economy: 8/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving. This makes the Nissan slightly less efficient than rivals like the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20200615/2020-subaru-crosstrek-review/"">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, and slightly more efficient than the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20191112/2020-hyundai-kona-review/"">Hyundai Kona</a>. It&#8217;s not, however, the worst in the segment, with the <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20200224/2020-jeep-cherokee-vs-compass-comparison-test/"">Jeep Compass</a> rated 1.0 L/100 km more combined.</p>&#13;<br /><h2>Driving Feel: 6/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>Firing up the Qashqai and setting off, you don&#8217;t get the same eagerness or enthusiasm found in other vehicles in the Nissan range like the smaller <a href=""https://www.autotrader.ca/expert/20200820/2020-nissan-kicks-vs-hyundai-venue-comparison-test/"">Kicks</a>. But the Qashqai doesn&#8217;t plod about either. It offers a simple driving experience &#8211; one that doesn&#8217;t feel engaging, nor is it carefree. Throttle response isn&#8217;t extremely energetic, and the light steering feel doesn&#8217;t inspire much confidence. While the suspension and ride aren&#8217;t too vague, if you push for speed on an on-ramp, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a lot of body roll. In these ways the Qashqai pales in comparison to the more responsive and engaging driving dynamics of the Crosstrek and Kona. The Qashqai excels when gently cruising on the highway, as the superb driver assistance features can do the heavy lifting.</p>&#13;<br /><img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/6/1/f/8/6/9/61f869f1c109b8d54bf6237077c4cdcadc699ad7.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/8/8/2/9/0/d/88290dcc6e166e4bbdf0af90f1146ee56bace954.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/1/1/8/3/b/51183b3e844c124f20074920009f2474de898233.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/a/6/5/d/c/e/a65dceae6373e8bde702e8566f53504bf21f8694.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/6/1/f/8/6/9/61f869f1c109b8d54bf6237077c4cdcadc699ad7.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/8/8/2/9/0/d/88290dcc6e166e4bbdf0af90f1146ee56bace954.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/5/1/1/8/3/b/51183b3e844c124f20074920009f2474de898233.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <img src=""https://cdntdreditorials.azureedge.net/cache/a/6/5/d/c/e/a65dceae6373e8bde702e8566f53504bf21f8694.jpg"">&#13;<br />                <p></p>&#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br />&#13;<br /> &#13;<br /><h2>Styling: 6/10</h2>&#13;<br /><p>Nissan has a mixed design language.

Las Cruces Sun-News

LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of creating a fictitious identity and using it to fraudulently purchase a brand-new vehicle — and nearly a second one before his arrest.

Richard Padilla, 32, who claimed an address of 999 W. Amador Ave., is charged with one second-degree felony count of fraud more than $20,000, two third-degree felony counts of attempted fraud of more than $20,000, two fourth-degree felony counts of forgery, a fourth-degree felony count of identity theft and a fourth-degree felony count of possession of methamphetamine.

Investigators believe Padilla either stole or obtained stolen mail and used information in it — including a paper driver’s license and a Social Security number — to create a fictitious identification. Investigators learned he used the photo from his driver’s license and copied it to the paper driver’s license that was stolen, creating a realistic-looking paper, or temporary, driver’s license.

Investigators learned Padilla used the fictious paperwork on Sept. 8 to purchase a 2020 Nissan Titan from a local dealership. The Nissan was valued at approximately $60,000. Padilla was trying to purchase a 2020 Ford F-150, valued at approximately $40,000, from another local dealership when he was detained for questioning by Las Cruces police.

Investigators learned Padilla also forged information to create a fake insurance document that was needed to complete the vehicle purchase. Padilla is also suspected of using the fake ID to cash checks.

Police encourage automobile dealerships — and other businesses that require identification cards to facilitate a transaction — to use caution when accepting a paper or temporary driver’s license. Police suggest taking all the necessary precautions in learning the true identity of the consumer before completing a transaction.

Similar cases of fraud and identity theft have been reported in Las Cruces within the last few months. Police are still investigating those cases.

Padilla was arrested Friday, Sept. 11, and booked into the Doña Ana County Detention Center where he is initially being held without bond.","<div><p class=""gnt_ar_by"">From Staff Reports</p><p class=""gnt_ar_pb"">Las Cruces Sun-News</p><img class=""gnt_em_img_i"" src=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/09/11/PNM2/e284d01c-765e-4de1-be24-55ca430737a8-Richard_Padilla_Arrest_mug_Aug_11_2020.jpg?width=300&amp;height=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp"" alt=""Richard Padilla""><p class=""gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd""></p><p class=""gnt_ar_b_p"">LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of creating a fictitious identity and using it to fraudulently purchase a brand-new vehicle &#8212; and nearly a second one before his arrest.</p><p class=""gnt_ar_b_p"">Richard Padilla, 32, who claimed an address of 999 W.

By 2025, 50% of kilometers driven on Uber’s platform in aggregate across seven European capitals (Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, London, Madrid and Paris) will be in electric vehicles.
This will mean that riders will be able to select a zero-emission vehicle in cities representing 80 percent of Uber European business by the end of 2021.
“This MoU with Uber is an acknowledgement of our ability to conquest new markets and to support professionals in their energy transition.
With the signature of this MoU we aim to join our forces to accelerate the movement”, said Gilles Normand, SVP, Electric Vehicles & Mobility Services, Groupe Renault.",15/09/2020,"Renault and Nissan, within their Alliance, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Uber with the aim of electrifying its customers’ journeys in Europe.The companies will now explore a strong partnership to provide partner drivers on the Uber App with affordable electric vehicles in European markets, notably in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. It follows a successful pilot between Nissan and Uber in the UK.

The MoU between the companies was announced today as part of Uber’s announcement to become a zero-emission mobility platform. By 2025, 50% of kilometers driven on Uber’s platform in aggregate across seven European capitals (Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, London, Madrid and Paris) will be in electric vehicles. This will mean that riders will be able to select a zero-emission vehicle in cities representing 80 percent of Uber European business by the end of 2021.

Under the MoU, the companies will now explore how working together can accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and the electric ecosystem in European cities, including efforts to:

Offer partner drivers on the Uber App access to Renault and Nissan electric vehicles: Renault ZOE and Nissan Leaf and future new EVs from both companies.

Extend the United Kingdom pilot into France by the end of 2020, with a view to scaling the program to the Netherlands, Portugal, and other markets.

Launch joint marketing and education plans to promote the electric vehicle offers and benefits to Uber’s partner drivers and offer test drives to allow them to experience the cars.

“This MoU with Uber is an acknowledgement of our ability to conquest new markets and to support professionals in their energy transition. Today, we capitalize on our competitive advantage: an attractive EV-offer that contributes to large scale electric mobility roll-out. We have worked closely with local authorities over the past years to propose solutions to the growing challenges facing cities: transportation, decarbonization and air quality. With the signature of this MoU we aim to join our forces to accelerate the movement”, said Gilles Normand, SVP, Electric Vehicles & Mobility Services, Groupe Renault.

Jordi Vila, Divisional Vice President for Sales and Marketing at Nissan Europe, added: “From 10 years of experience with the Nissan LEAF, we know people love driving electric, and that making the switch can help drivers to save money and support the clean air ambitions of our major cities. By teaming up with Uber in the UK, we have already been able to increase the awareness and adoption of zero-emission vehicles, and we are looking forward to exploring how to roll that out further in Europe.”

U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell issued a ruling that approved the extradition of Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his son Peter. The Taylors were arrested in May and held in Massachusetts after they were arrested in May of this year.

Attorneys for the father and son did not deny the allegations but argued against extradition on the grounds that their actions were not covered by the law with which Japan is trying to convict them.

Japan plans to charge the pair under Article 103 of the nation’s penal code, which prohibits harboring criminals and enabling the flight of anyone who has committed a crime or escaped confinement, Bloomberg reported.

Japan requested to extradite the pair on charges that they helped former Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee Japan last year, smuggling him in a box onto a private jet that flew to Turkey, then to Lebanon, where Ghosn has citizenship but no extradition treaty with Japan.

Ghosn claims he fled Japan as he would not face a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions.

Because Ghosn was out on bail when he fled, lawyers for the Taylors argue that authorities were not actively pursuing him.

In his ruling, Cabell sided with Japanese and U.S. prosecutors, saying the Taylors’ actions brought them “squarely within the purview” of Article 103. “They harbored or enabled the escape of Carlos Ghosn,” he wrote.

Ghosn stands accused of underreporting his income and diverting Nissan money for personal gain. Records show that he wired more than $800,000 to Peter Taylor in October 2019, and that Ghosen’s son made crypto payments of around $500,000 to Taylor earlier in 2020.

The Taylors have reportedly spent more than $100,000 on lawyers and lobbyists to press their case in Washington, particularly with the White House and State Department.

The final decision as to whether or not the pair will be extradited will rest with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Six days before the car is revealed, the latest clip shows a manual lever displaying an H-pattern gearbox layout with six speeds, to the background noise of what’s almost certainly a turbocharged V6 engine being revved. Good news all round, we’d say, even if no actual official information has been supplied.

As mentioned when the last preview video went out (scroll down for earlier stories), the Proto Z is expected to share its underpinnings and motor with Infiniti’s performance saloons. But the fitment of a manual with that circa-400hp engine will make the Proto Z unique in Nissan and its sister brand’s line-up; and a whole lot more attractive to those who prefer the workload of three pedals, especially if they've been longing for a 370Z replacement.

It’s thanks to that old car’s performance and the capability shown by the V6 in Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 that we’re so confident the incoming machine will have around 400hp. That would place it smack bang on par with the Audi TT RS, but thanks to rear-wheel drive – also anticipated because of those Infinitis – and the manual, not to mention the Zed car’s unique design, Nissan’s offering looks well placed to play a more substantial role in the segment. But, pleasingly for us lot, it looks like the focus is first and foremost on the enthusiasts.

Previous story: 07/09/2020

Nine days before Nissan pulls the covers off its Z Proto sports car, the manufacturer has posted a video that seems to show a manual gear lever on the transmission tunnel. Oh yes. The blink-and-you’ll-miss-it clip, presumably there to get us all excited about the Z Proto’s gearbox, features an actor’s hand that grabs a lever in the manner of a manual ‘box. It’s the first potentially tangible piece of evidence to back all of the speculation behind Nissan’s upcoming two-door.

The car is also expected to come with a turbocharged V6 engine, borrowed from Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 performance models with a circa 400hp output. The platform itself is also expected to be shared with those models, making us pretty confident that the Z Proto will be rear-drive, too. A V6-powered, manual rear-drive coupe from Japan is something everyone, not just fans of the Zed lineage, can understand the significance of, especially in 2020.

Aside from the gearbox hint, today’s video does little to prove or disprove the predictions for the model’s technical setup. Earlier previews have shown that its two-door body will place its occupants in the middle, behind an extended bonnet and in front of a taut rear-end. That bodes well for balance and weight distribution, and while much of it looks new, we spot some design influences from the car's forebears, particularly at the rear.

It all has us very excited for what's to come. Rest assured we'll be keeping a close eye on Nissan’s digital channels for any more information in the coming days. All things suggest the 16th September reveal will be one well worth tuning in for.

Original story: 01.09.2020

It's been a long time coming, but now there is confirmation from Nissan that the next Zed sports car - or the Z Proto preview, at least - isn't that far off: all will be revealed on September 16th.

Which, for those of us seduced by front-engined, rear-drive, six-cylinder Nissan sports cars over the past half a century, is excellent news. Because not only have there been some real heroes over the past 50 years - the original 240 and the 350 of 2003 spring to mind - we've been waiting an eternity for a new one. There are 370Zs out there on an '09 plate, fundamentally the same package as is still available with a 2020 registration. And the Zed wasn't without flaws in the first decade of the 21st century, so it's desperately due an overhaul now.

Hopefully this Z Proto will give a good indication on what to expect; all that's seen of it in this video is the vaguest of silhouette and headlight profiles. The vid is instead dedicated to the Zed history, the enormous of amount of heritage and success that Nissan will hope to influence the new car with. Because while there have been some less than great Zed cars, if this new one can combine the best attributes of the good'ns - brawny performance, great looks, fun handling - then you'd have to assume that Nissan would be on to something. Even if the commonly accepted idea of a coupe nowadays seems to have a raised ride height and a kerbweight in excess of two tonnes.

Whether it's a 400Z, electrified or not, a conventional two seater or 2+2, the right blend of Zed characteristics will surely see Nissan right in a new car. We won't know anything more about that car for a couple of weeks, though; best then to settle in and bask in the Nissan sports car heritage. And if 58 seconds is insufficient, then there's definitely permission granted to watch Tokyo Drift as well; after all, it's not every day a new Nissan Zed car is announced...","<div><p class=""&#127950;2uDbQu &#127950;16v_t3""></p><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><p>Nissan has all but confirmed that its upcoming Proto Z sports car will use a manual and turbocharged V6 in its latest preview video.

The hefty government guarantee suggests financial firms are cautious about helping to fund the automaker as it seeks to return to profitability and stop bleeding cash.

The government has guaranteed 104 billion yen of the 180 billion in loans from the DBJ, said the source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the information is not public.

Three other sources told Reuters in May the government would guarantee part of a loan from Mizuho Financial Group Inc , aimed at helping Nissan ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.

All eight versions – three engine-gearbox options and four trim levels – are available with the same benefits. The Kicks now has two petrol engine options – a 106hp, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated unit and a 156hp, 1.3-litre turbo-petrol mill.

178,178,178,https://www.autonews.com/legal-file/trial-date-arrives-american-nissan-exec,Trial date arrives for American Nissan exec,"Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest.
Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity.
""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney.
Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.
But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.",13/09/2020,"TOKYO — Nissan's indicted former boss Carlos Ghosn has fled, but the American lieutenant he left behind in Japan — Greg Kelly, accused of being his accomplice — finally heads to court in Tokyo this week in a closely watched case that will bring some measure of closure to the corporate saga.

Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest.

Kelly was released on bail that Christmas but has been required to live in Japan, where he and his lawyers have been plowing through mountains of evidence to prepare for their defense.

Kelly, a human resources manager who climbed Nissan's global executive ladder from its operations in Tennessee, is charged with orchestrating a plan to conceal more than $80 million in deferred remuneration to Ghosn over the 2010-17 fiscal years, resulting in the information not being reported in Nissan's public financial documents.

Ghosn was arrested separately the same day as Kelly in a coordinated sweep by Japanese prosecutors. But Ghosn jumped bail at the end of December 2019 and fled to Lebanon.

If found guilty, Kelly could face up to a decade of prison in Japan.

His trial will be long. It is expected to run through July, with a verdict no earlier than fall 2021.

Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity. While Nissan is expected to not contest the charges, Kelly and Ghosn maintain their innocence.

Kelly rose from his job as Nissan's top U.S. human resources executive in Nashville to become an executive vice president with the Renault-Nissan Alliance and eventually a director on Nissan's board in Japan.

He has said that Nissan money earmarked for Ghosn was not part of a scheme to provide deferred compensation. On the contrary, it was a legal draft of a post-retirement contract intended to keep Ghosn as an adviser to the Japanese carmaker and prevent him from bolting to a competitor. Kelly maintains that the amount of the compensation was never fixed, the contracts were never signed, and nothing was ever paid.

""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney. ""The statute is laughably obtuse and vague. He is clearly innocent.""

The case is drawing international support for the former Nissan director, who spent the last few years of his career working in Japan for the automaker.

Three U.S. senators published a letter in support of Kelly this year. Sens. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee called Kelly's predicament a ""cautionary tale"" for Americans working in Japan.

As he awaited trial on bail, he was prevented from leaving Japan and has been living in a Tokyo apartment, where he has been joined by his wife from Nashville. In order to stay in Japan, his wife studies Japanese language on a student visa and must maintain high standing or run the risk of losing legal immigration status.

Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.

Ghosn was once pinned as a friendly witness backing Kelly's defense, until he bolted Japan. But Kelly holds no animosity toward his former boss for leaving him to go it alone, Wareham said.

Among the challenges faced by Kelly's legal team are digging through a mountain of evidence and lacking access to dozens more boxes of documents that his attorneys said were being withheld.

The first installment of evidence from prosecutors was an 11-terabyte data dump — equivalent to 1 billion documents.

Since then, prosecutors say they have produced another 84 boxes of materials. But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.

Language will be another challenge.

The court has denied Kelly's request for simultaneous interpretation during the proceedings, Wareham added. Instead, interpretation will be consecutive, effectively doubling the trial time.

The long wait between the end of the trial in July and the verdict is another bone of contention.

""Overall, the Japanese legal system is barbaric, outdated and grossly unfair,"" Wareham said.","<div><p class="""">TOKYO &#8212; Nissan's indicted former boss Carlos Ghosn has fled, but the American lieutenant he left behind in Japan &#8212; Greg Kelly, accused of being his accomplice &#8212; finally heads to court in Tokyo this week in a closely watched case that will bring some measure of closure to the corporate saga.</p><p class="""">Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest. </p><p class="""">Kelly was released on bail that Christmas but has been required to live in Japan, where he and his lawyers have been plowing through mountains of evidence to prepare for their defense. </p><p class="""">Kelly, a human resources manager who climbed Nissan's global executive ladder from its operations in Tennessee, is charged with orchestrating a plan to conceal more than $80 million in deferred remuneration to Ghosn over the 2010-17 fiscal years, resulting in the information not being reported in Nissan's public financial documents.</p><p class="""">Ghosn was arrested separately the same day as Kelly in a coordinated sweep by Japanese prosecutors.

There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997.
The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation.
1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours.
Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.",14/09/2020,"Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!

John’s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race’s ‘coulda, shoulda, woulda’ programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.

The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later. I had a look at Toyota’s effort a week or so ago, and in the shadow of this year’s great race, it also appropriate to consider another contender of the time, the Nissan R390.

After the demise of Group C and IMSA GTP in 1992 and 1993, the rules were structured to make the GT category more in tune with road cars, so the Japanese manufacturers responded by building GT versions of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Honda NSX and of course the Toyota Supra LM. These true road car evolutions were outclassed by the McLaren F1 GTR at Le Mans in 1995; not entirely unexpected given the philosophy behind Woking’s finest.

Frustrated by the multiple successes of the F1 GTR on the tracks during the BPR era of 1995 and 1996, Porsche brought a gun to the knife fight with the introduction of their 911 GT1. So it was clear that to have any prospect of success, a supercar would have to be designed and built and in double quick time too. There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997. Get the car designed and built by one of the specialists and who better than Tom Walkinshaw Racing? TWR had a record second to none in running motorsport projects for manufacturers, especially at Le Mans, where their outright wins in 1988 and 1990 for Jaguar had passed into legend.

So when Nissan wanted an answer to the question of what to do next in pursuit of victory at Le Mans the answer was to engage TWR. In addition to TWR’s experience on the track, the company still had the services of Tony Southgate, who had designed the successful Jaguars of the Group C/IMSA era. As Project Leader for TWR, Southgate came up with a state of the art chassis and bodywork made of composite materials, carbon fibre and kevlar.

Adding complexity to the whole project was the requirement to produce a road car that could be sold to the public. TWR Design was headed by Ian Callum, designer/creator of the Aston Martin DB7 and he styled and oversaw the production of the Nissan R390 road car, the fastest and most expensive road car ever produced by Nissan. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz GT1 project, Nissan created the road car first and thereby conformed to the spirit as well as the letter of the regulations. It was all in vain though, as the rules changed just before the start of the season allowing the road car to be produced any time during the calendar year. Mercedes-Benz showed their contempt for the process by unveiling their street-legal version of the CLK GTR in late December, months after the FIA GT Championship had been run and won.

Callum made styling references to the rest of the Nissan product range and heritage, using the twin front grills that gave a subliminal message “Nissan” and also the headlights had their origins in the 300SX. There were only two examples of the R390 built for the public highway, with a 0-60mph time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 220moh, all at a price tag of $1 million.

Nissan, or more accurately, NISMO rummaged around the back of the engine storeroom and found the V8 that used to power the 1990 Group C Le Mans entries. This 3.5 litre twin turbo V8, codenamed VRH35L, had been extensively updated since its previous visit to La Sarthe to cope with the new demands imposed by air restrictors, especially in the area of friction reduction. The engine had two overhead camshafts per bank of cylinders with 32 valves in total. There were 2 IHI turbos and the power “over 600bhp” was sent to the rear wheels through a transversally mounted six speed sequential gearbox designed and built by X-Trac. Tyres were provided by Bridgestone.

The final piece of the jigsaw was to assemble the team for the attempt on the world’s greatest race. Nissan had failed in their previous attempts on the French classic, most notably in 1990 when despite having the best car, political in-fighting and lack of co-operation between the British, American and Japanese teams (yes three separate teams!) they conspired to lose the race to Jaguar and TWR. This time things would be different.

While Tony Southgate headed up the TWR side of the operation, Tom Walkinshaw himself being on Grand Prix duty with Arrows, Kunihiko Kakimoto was Nissan and NISMO’s man in charge. For the race, there were 115 members of the team, 40 from TWR and the rest from Japan.

The team had a very strong pool of drivers available to them. Number 21 had TWR’s favourite son, Martin Brundle, with Jörg Müller and Wayne Taylor, a late substitute for the injured Mauro Martini, joining him behind the wheel. Number 22 was crewed by Riccardo Patrese, Aguri Suzuki and Eric Van de Poele. The third R390, number 23, had Eric Comas, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama on driving duties.

The attraction of the World’s Greatest Race is attested by the number of entries, always in excess of the track’s licensed limit. 1997 was no exception with 86 applications which the Selection Committee of the ACO whittled down to 76. These were invited to turn up at the beginning of May to see who would go forward to the race itself. One entry dropped out, six were granted exemption by virtue of 1995 results, so 69 cars scrapped for the 46 places on pit road during race week itself, some six weeks hence. Oh, and of those 46, four would go home early, all nice and clear.

For factory teams such as Nissan, this system gave a few sleepless nights, as if they did not achieve the right level of performance on the day then it was no race after all that effort and expense.

The cars were split up into two groups, one running on Saturday, the balance on Sunday. Everyone in the paddock was given a reminder of the ever-present dangers in the sport when an accident on Saturday claimed the life of the promising young French driver, Sebastian Enjolras. There was little enthusiasm for running during the rest of the day. The timesheets were topped by the McLaren F1 GTR of JJ Lehto with 3:45.973. The #22 Nissan was around three seconds back but comfortably in the race.

The pace hotted up on Sunday and as usual, the teams all put on stickier rubber as the clock ticked towards the end of the session and no one wanted to be left standing when the music stopped. For #21 there would be no worries as Martin Brundle was in outstanding form, scorching round in 3:43.152 to record the fastest time of the weekend. To complete a good weekend for the Anglo-Japanese team #23 was also in with ease. Quiet satisfaction and a job list of improvements to be made were the conclusions taken away – next up, the race!

Fastest in the Pre-Qualifying Weekend, the mood in the TWR Nissan camp would have been reasonably confident. Or it should have been: those of us on the outside had heard that there had been a successful three-day test at Magny Cours and all was plain sailing.

The more observant (not me, I hasten to add) would have questioned why the exhaust system had been re-routed from back to side, not something lightly undertaken. The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.

It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR “forgot” this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.

Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut’s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.

The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.

Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah… TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.

R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. “Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.”

Prophetic words…

Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.

As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.

“The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,” was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.

The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.

All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.

A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. “I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,” said Erik Comas. “It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.” Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.

During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with “a serious gearbox” problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.

At 4.24 am Jörg Müller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: “I agreed with my engineer that we’d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.”

What might have been… two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.

Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: “Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish”.

Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.

It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: “I believe we proved the Nissan car’s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.”

So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?

A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.

There were three ’98 spec cars and one ’97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.

The fourth R390 was the ’97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new ’98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.

As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.

In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: “I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.” He had also earned a drive in the race itself.

Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.

The simple answer was no.

Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the ’97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.

1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.

For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.

The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.

Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.

So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998’s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.

The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle’s Toyota and Schneider’s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.

In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan’s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider’s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.

Next, it was BMW’s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.

So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.

At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.

Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.

Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390’s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.

Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; Müller having a spin, damaging the Porsche’s undertray and McNish’s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.

Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.

And so that’s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan’s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.

So much for the good news.

The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:

Tokyo … Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.

Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan’s motorsports arm in August.

The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.

Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.

The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.","<div><p><strong>Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!</strong></p><br /><p>John&#8217;s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race&#8217;s &#8216;coulda, shoulda, woulda&#8217; programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.</p><br /><p>The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later. I had a look at Toyota&#8217;s effort a week or so ago, and in the shadow of this year&#8217;s great race, it also appropriate to consider another contender of the time, the Nissan R390.</p><br /><p>After the demise of Group C and IMSA GTP in 1992 and 1993, the rules were structured to make the GT category more in tune with road cars, so the Japanese manufacturers responded by building GT versions of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Honda NSX and of course the Toyota Supra LM. These true road car evolutions were outclassed by the McLaren F1 GTR at Le Mans in 1995; not entirely unexpected given the philosophy behind Woking&#8217;s finest.</p><br /><p>Frustrated by the multiple successes of the F1 GTR on the tracks during the BPR era of 1995 and 1996, Porsche brought a gun to the knife fight with the introduction of their 911 GT1. So it was clear that to have any prospect of success, a supercar would have to be designed and built and in double quick time too. There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997. Get the car designed and built by one of the specialists and who better than Tom Walkinshaw Racing? TWR had a record second to none in running motorsport projects for manufacturers, especially at Le Mans, where their outright wins in 1988 and 1990 for Jaguar had passed into legend.</p><br /><p>So when Nissan wanted an answer to the question of what to do next in pursuit of victory at Le Mans the answer was to engage TWR. In addition to TWR&#8217;s experience on the track, the company still had the services of Tony Southgate, who had designed the successful Jaguars of the Group C/IMSA era. As Project Leader for TWR, Southgate came up with a state of the art chassis and bodywork made of composite materials, carbon fibre and kevlar.</p><br /><p>Adding complexity to the whole project was the requirement to produce a road car that could be sold to the public. TWR Design was headed by Ian Callum, designer/creator of the Aston Martin DB7 and he styled and oversaw the production of the Nissan R390 road car, the fastest and most expensive road car ever produced by Nissan. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz GT1 project, Nissan created the road car first and thereby conformed to the spirit as well as the letter of the regulations. It was all in vain though, as the rules changed just before the start of the season allowing the road car to be produced any time during the calendar year. Mercedes-Benz showed their contempt for the process by unveiling their street-legal version of the CLK GTR in late December, months after the FIA GT Championship had been run and won.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277426"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Callum made styling references to the rest of the Nissan product range and heritage, using the twin front grills that gave a subliminal message &#8220;Nissan&#8221; and also the headlights had their origins in the 300SX. There were only two examples of the R390 built for the public highway, with a 0-60mph time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 220moh, all at a price tag of $1 million.</p><br /><p>Nissan, or more accurately, NISMO rummaged around the back of the engine storeroom and found the V8 that used to power the 1990 Group C Le Mans entries. This 3.5 litre twin turbo V8, codenamed VRH35L, had been extensively updated since its previous visit to La Sarthe to cope with the new demands imposed by air restrictors, especially in the area of friction reduction. The engine had two overhead camshafts per bank of cylinders with 32 valves in total. There were 2 IHI turbos and the power &#8220;over 600bhp&#8221; was sent to the rear wheels through a transversally mounted six speed sequential gearbox designed and built by X-Trac. Tyres were provided by Bridgestone.</p><br /><p>The final piece of the jigsaw was to assemble the team for the attempt on the world&#8217;s greatest race. Nissan had failed in their previous attempts on the French classic, most notably in 1990 when despite having the best car, political in-fighting and lack of co-operation between the British, American and Japanese teams (yes three separate teams!) they conspired to lose the race to Jaguar and TWR. This time things would be different.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277427"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""435""></a></p><br /><p>While Tony Southgate headed up the TWR side of the operation, Tom Walkinshaw himself being on Grand Prix duty with Arrows, Kunihiko Kakimoto was Nissan and NISMO&#8217;s man in charge. For the race, there were 115 members of the team, 40 from TWR and the rest from Japan.</p><br /><p>The team had a very strong pool of drivers available to them. Number 21 had TWR&#8217;s favourite son, Martin Brundle, with J&#246;rg M&#252;ller and Wayne Taylor, a late substitute for the injured Mauro Martini, joining him behind the wheel. Number 22 was crewed by Riccardo Patrese, Aguri Suzuki and Eric Van de Poele. The third R390, number 23, had Eric Comas, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama on driving duties.</p><br /><p>The attraction of the World&#8217;s Greatest Race is attested by the number of entries, always in excess of the track&#8217;s licensed limit. 1997 was no exception with 86 applications which the Selection Committee of the ACO whittled down to 76. These were invited to turn up at the beginning of May to see who would go forward to the race itself. One entry dropped out, six were granted exemption by virtue of 1995 results, so 69 cars scrapped for the 46 places on pit road during race week itself, some six weeks hence. Oh, and of those 46, four would go home early, all nice and clear.</p><br /><p>For factory teams such as Nissan, this system gave a few sleepless nights, as if they did not achieve the right level of performance on the day then it was no race after all that effort and expense.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277428"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>The cars were split up into two groups, one running on Saturday, the balance on Sunday. Everyone in the paddock was given a reminder of the ever-present dangers in the sport when an accident on Saturday claimed the life of the promising young French driver, Sebastian Enjolras. There was little enthusiasm for running during the rest of the day. The timesheets were topped by the McLaren F1 GTR of JJ Lehto with 3:45.973. The #22 Nissan was around three seconds back but comfortably in the race.</p><br /><p>The pace hotted up on Sunday and as usual, the teams all put on stickier rubber as the clock ticked towards the end of the session and no one wanted to be left standing when the music stopped. For #21 there would be no worries as Martin Brundle was in outstanding form, scorching round in 3:43.152 to record the fastest time of the weekend. To complete a good weekend for the Anglo-Japanese team #23 was also in with ease. Quiet satisfaction and a job list of improvements to be made were the conclusions taken away &#8211; next up, the race!</p><br /><p>Fastest in the Pre-Qualifying Weekend, the mood in the TWR Nissan camp would have been reasonably confident. Or it should have been: those of us on the outside had heard that there had been a successful three-day test at Magny Cours and all was plain sailing.</p><br /><p>The more observant (not me, I hasten to add) would have questioned why the exhaust system had been re-routed from back to side, not something lightly undertaken. The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277429"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR &#8220;forgot&#8221; this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.</p><br /><p>Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut&#8217;s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.</p><br /><p>The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.</p><br /><p>Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah&#8230; TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.</p><br /><p>R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. &#8220;Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Prophetic words&#8230;</p><br /><p>Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.</p><br /><p>As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277430"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""675""></a></p><br /><p>&#8220;The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,&#8221; was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.</p><br /><p>The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.</p><br /><p>All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.</p><br /><p>A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. &#8220;I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,&#8221; said Erik Comas. &#8220;It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.&#8221; Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277431"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with &#8220;a serious gearbox&#8221; problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.</p><br /><p>At 4.24 am J&#246;rg M&#252;ller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: &#8220;I agreed with my engineer that we&#8217;d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.&#8221;</p><br /><p>What might have been&#8230; two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.</p><br /><p>Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: &#8220;Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish&#8221;.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277432"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.</p><br /><p>It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: &#8220;I believe we proved the Nissan car&#8217;s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.&#8221;</p><br /><p>So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?</p><br /><p>A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.</p><br /><p>There were three &#8217;98 spec cars and one &#8217;97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277433"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>The fourth R390 was the &#8217;97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new &#8217;98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.</p><br /><p>As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: &#8220;I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.&#8221; He had also earned a drive in the race itself.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277434"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.</p><br /><p>The simple answer was no.</p><br /><p>Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the &#8217;97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.</p><br /><p>1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.</p><br /><p>For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.</p><br /><p>The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.</p><br /><p>Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.</p><br /><p>So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998&#8217;s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.</p><br /><p>The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle&#8217;s Toyota and Schneider&#8217;s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.</p><br /><p>In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan&#8217;s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider&#8217;s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.</p><br /><p>Next, it was BMW&#8217;s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.</p><br /><p>So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.</p><br /><p>At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277435"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.</p><br /><p>Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390&#8217;s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.</p><br /><p>Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; M&#252;ller having a spin, damaging the Porsche&#8217;s undertray and McNish&#8217;s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.</p><br /><p>Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277436"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>And so that&#8217;s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan&#8217;s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277437"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>So much for the good news.</p><br /><p>The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:</p><br /><p>Tokyo &#8230; Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.</p><br /><p>Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan&#8217;s motorsports arm in August.</p><br /><p>The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.</p><br /><p>Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.</p><br /><p>The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277438"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br />        </div>",0.083,0.079,0.9114,qruSw3GrGbaMRBpTEEfgvS,,

The 30-second teaser, uploaded to Nissan's YouTube channel yesterday, shows us rear light clusters inspired by the 300ZX, and body lines taken from the original 240Z. But the most interesting part of the video comes near the end, where a driver is shown reaching for what seems to be a shift knob placed in the center console.

Granted, we're not ever shown what the shifter looks like, so for all we know, it could just be an automatic gear selector that Nissan is teasing. Though considering the car's sporting intentions, we're hopeful it's not.

The newspaper cites two sources who claim production was originally set to begin in October, although that date has not been confirmed by the Japanese car maker.

In a statement sent to Autocar, Nissan said: ""Preparations continue for the launch of the new Qashqai in Sunderland, which represents a £400m investment in the plant.""

The firm added: ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

The FT indicated that the apparent delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed development and changed the firm's priorities. It suggested the delay could also allow Nissan to work out its course of action should Britain not secure a deal with the European Union post-Brexit.

Just over half of the approximately 500,000 cars produced at Sunderland annually are exported to Europe, and two-thirds of those are Qashqais. Any trade tariffs with the EU would ""jeopardise"" Sunderland's business model, bosses have previously claimed.

The report suggests that production of the new Qashqai will not begin until after April 2021. The current version has been on sale since 2014.

Making half-a-million of any type of vehicle is impressive, but this plucky little Japanese EV has captured the hearts and minds of consumers as a genuinely viable alternative to gasoline vehicles.

Just ask Maria Jensen of Norway, who purchased the 500,000th example.

“My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it. We’re very excited to become the proud owners of the 500,000th Nissan Leaf. This car really meets our needs with extended range and enhanced technologies.”

The Leaf has been in production since 2011, and since then earned its place as the world’s best-selling electric car. (It was overtaken only recently by the Tesla Model 3, which crossed a half-million units earlier this year.)

Reveal set for September 16

The ageing Nissan 370Z sports car will soon be replaced by an all-new model, likely called the 400Z. Nissan will reveal a concept for the new car (called the Z Proto) on September 16th and has released numerous teasers giving you an idea of what to expect from its new Toyota Supra rival.

Many of these hints have come in the form of a promotional video, embedded above. While they are quite indistinct, they do show the car will feature similar proportions to Z-cars of the past, including the 240z, 300ZX, 350Z and 370Z.

The Z Proto’s headlights will take inspiration from the classic 240Z.

As such, you can expect it to come with a long bonnet, heavily raked windscreen, two-door design and circular daytime-running lights that mimic the round headlights fitted to the classic 240Z sportscar from the 1970s.

This sketch has echos of the ’90s 300ZX sports car.

An official drawing of the new car’s rear end shared on Instagram by Nissan’s Vice-President of global design appears to show a strong design influence from the 300ZX sports car of the early 1990s.

A tweet from Nissan’s Australian division gives you a chance to hear the new car’s engine for the first time. The Z Proto and 400Z are expected to come with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine and the smooth, yet slightly muted, revs of the car in the video supports this. Adding turbochargers means Nissan can downsize the new car’s engine without sacrificing any power. Expect the new Z to come with a 3.0-litre engine producing more power than the outgoing Nissan 370Z’s 328hp 3.7-litre unit.

This image confirms the new Z will come with a manual gearbox.

Like the outgoing Nissan 370Z, and the 350Z before that, the new 400Z will come with a manual gearbox – something of a rarity these days. However, you’ll almost certainly be able to pay extra to get an automatic gearbox if you’d prefer.

You’ll probably have to wait until 2023 to get your hands on the new Z.

Nissan 400Z price and release date

When it goes on sale either in 2022 or early in 2023, the new Z will give Nissan a direct rival for the popular Toyota Supra, reigniting a battle first seen in the 1980s and 1990s. Nissan will reveal the full Z Proto concept online at 01:30 am on September 16. The new Z will likely cost more than the £30,000 outgoing car, partly as a result of having a twin-turbo, rather than naturally aspirated, engine.

The news for the next-generation Micra came from Nissan’s Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta during an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.
“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.
The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants.

The current Micra is already being manufactured at Renault’s Flins factory in France, but the facility is expected to phase out vehicle assembly and focus instead on recycling activities from around 2024.

The news for the next-generation Micra came from Nissan’s Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta during an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.

Gupta said that the plan for Nissan’s Ford Fiesta and VW Polo rival is part of the new ‘leader-follower’ strategy within the Alliance, which stipulates that one automaker takes the lead on specific model segments.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

The ‘leader-follower’ strategy will also put Renault in charge of the Alliance’s future small B-SUV models, such as the Renault Captur and Nissan Juke, for Europe, while Nissan will lead in the next-generation of C-SUV models, like the Qashqai (Rogue Sport in NA) and its sister model, the Renault Kadjar.

The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants. The range-topping variant is the Micra N-Line, which is powered by a turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder with 115 HP paired to a six-speed manual transmission.

2020 Nissan Titan





2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab Starting Price: $40,485 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; good towing capability; available 4WD; serious off-road chops in Pro-4X trim, long warranty.

Below Average: Only one drivetrain offered; high entry-level price; aging chassis and design.

Consensus: Capable and refined, the Titan offers a powerful V8 as its only drivetrain choice. With a single wheelbase for crew cab models and only five trim levels, Nissan offers a much simpler approach to the new truck buying process.

2020 Ram 1500





2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Starting Price: $33,590 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Styling; hybrid engine option; coil spring and air suspension; ride quality; rear-seat legroom.

Below Average: Upper trims get expensive; limited powertrain choices; 8- instead of a 10-speed transmission.

Consensus: The Ram offers a bold exterior without going overboard. It also offers numerous unique options like an air suspension and a massive 12-inch touch-screen infotainment setup. There’s plenty of powertrains and trims from which to choose.

Titan vs. Ram 1500: Old newcomer or new oldtimer

Nissan Titan Crew Cab

Nissan has a short history of building full-size pickups. And yet its 2020 Titan, despite a recent facelift, is older than the newly redesigned Ram 1500. As a newcomer, the Titan brings some car-buying sensibility to the truck market. Rather than offering a confusing array of drivetrains, wheelbase lengths, and packages, the Titan is much more straightforward with a single 400-horsepower V8 and 9-speed automatic drivetrain, one wheelbase length and only five trim levels. While it makes things simple, it also limits your choice. At its entry point, the Titan is thousands more than the Ram. Titan does offer a wide range of equipment from the Spartan S model up through the plush Platinum Reserve. Of special note is the off-road 4-wheel drive Pro-4X version that offers serious off-road capability. Another plus is a standard suite of driver and safety assists.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab

The Ram, fresh off a 2019 makeover, offers handsome styling, an impressive number of trims and features, and improved towing and payload numbers. The base engine is a mild hybrid 3.6-liter V6 called eTorque. That same tech is available on the workhorse 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which helps boost that model’s fuel economy numbers. The big thing that separates the Ram from other pickups is its use of a coil-spring independent rear suspension. Even in base form without the optional airbag suspension, this setup imparts a great ride without sacrificing towing or load-carrying capability. We also like the user-friendly Uconnect infotainment system. Like the Titan, there’s plenty of upscale trims to turn your workhorse into a showhorse, but you’ll pay a pretty penny. Some of that investment will be returned due to the Ram’s proven durability and good resale.

Similarities

Expansive model ranges with rear- and 4-wheel drive; top ranges offer luxury car amenities; similar entry-level sticker prices; high durability and solid resale value.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab Advantages

Coil spring rear suspension; large easy-to-use infotainment screen; more rear-seat legroom with reclining seats; lower price; hybrid engines.

Nissan Titan Crew Cab Advantages

Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; off-road Pro-4X trim; standard driver and safety assists; long warranty.

Final Recommendation

While the Nissan Titan has plenty of power from its 5.6-liter V8, that alone doesn’t close the deal here. And while you have to work harder to find the right truck from the myriad of combinations offered by Ram, you’ll likely find something that closely matches your needs at a lower price.

With a single wheelbase for crew cab models and only five trim levels, Nissan offers a much simpler approach to the new truck buying process.</p><br /><h3><strong>2020 Ram 1500<br><br /><img class=""alignnone wp-image-201112 size-large native-lazyload-js-fallback"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" alt=""2020 Ram 1500"" width=""763"" height=""430""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-201112 size-large"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/763x430-5ycto-2020-ram-1500.jpg?w=763"" alt=""2020 Ram 1500"" width=""763"" height=""430""><br><br /></strong></h3><br /><p><strong>2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Starting Price: </strong>$33,590<strong> | <a href=""https://www.kbb.com/ram/1500-crew-cab/"">Price yours </a></strong>or <strong><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/all/new-cars/ram/1500/"">View listings near you</a></strong></p><br /><p><strong>Above Average: </strong>&#160;Styling; hybrid engine option; coil spring and air suspension; ride quality; rear-seat legroom.</p><br /><p><strong>Below Average: </strong>&#160;Upper trims get expensive; limited powertrain choices; 8- instead of a 10-speed transmission.</p><br /><p><strong>Consensus: </strong>The Ram offers a bold exterior without going overboard. It also offers numerous unique options like an air suspension and a massive 12-inch touch-screen infotainment setup. There&#8217;s plenty of powertrains and trims from which to choose.</p><br /><h3><strong>Titan vs. Ram 1500: Old newcomer or new oldtimer&#160;</strong></h3><br /><h3><strong>Nissan Titan Crew Cab</strong></h3><br /><p>Nissan has a short history of building full-size pickups. And yet its 2020 Titan, despite a recent facelift, is older than the newly redesigned Ram 1500. As a newcomer, the Titan brings some car-buying sensibility to the truck market. Rather than offering a confusing array of drivetrains, wheelbase lengths, and packages, the Titan is much more straightforward with a single 400-horsepower V8 and 9-speed automatic drivetrain, one wheelbase length and only five trim levels. While it makes things simple, it also limits your choice. At its entry point, the Titan is thousands more than the Ram. Titan does offer a wide range of equipment from the Spartan S model up through the plush Platinum Reserve. Of special note is the off-road 4-wheel drive Pro-4X version that offers serious off-road capability. Another plus is a standard suite of driver and safety assists.</p><br /><h3><strong>Ram 1500 Crew Cab</strong></h3><br /><p>The Ram, fresh off a 2019 makeover, offers handsome styling, an impressive number of trims and features, and improved towing and payload numbers. The base engine is a mild hybrid 3.6-liter V6 called eTorque. That same tech is available on the workhorse 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which helps boost that model&#8217;s fuel economy numbers. The big thing that separates the Ram from other pickups is its use of a coil-spring independent rear suspension. Even in base form without the optional airbag suspension, this setup imparts a great ride without sacrificing towing or load-carrying capability. We also like the user-friendly Uconnect infotainment system. Like the Titan, there&#8217;s plenty of upscale trims to turn your workhorse into a showhorse, but you&#8217;ll pay a pretty penny. Some of that investment will be returned due to the Ram&#8217;s proven durability and good resale.</p><br /><h3><strong>Similarities</strong></h3><br /><p>Expansive model ranges with rear- and 4-wheel drive; top ranges offer luxury car amenities; similar entry-level sticker prices; high durability and solid resale value.</p><br /><h3><strong>Ram 1500 Crew Cab Advantages</strong></h3><br /><p>Coil spring rear suspension; large easy-to-use infotainment screen; more rear-seat legroom with reclining seats; lower price; hybrid engines.</p><br /><h3><b>Nissan Titan Crew Cab Advantages</b></h3><br /><p>Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; off-road Pro-4X trim; standard driver and safety assists; long warranty.</p><br /><h3><strong>Final Recommendation</strong></h3><br /><p>While the Nissan Titan has plenty of power from its 5.6-liter V8, that alone doesn&#8217;t close the deal here. And while you have to work harder to find the right truck from the myriad of combinations offered by Ram, you&#8217;ll likely find something that closely matches your needs at a lower price.</p><br /><p><strong>Ready to buy a Nissan Titan or Ram 1500? </strong><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/""><strong>Shop now for one on sale near you.</strong></a></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab</strong><br /><strong>2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Popular Powertrains</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Engine<br />5.6 -liter V8<br />3.6-liter V6 Hybrid<br /><br /><br />Horsepower<br />400 hp @ 5,800 rpm<br />305 hp @ 6,400 rpm<br /><br /><br />Torque<br />413 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm<br />269 lb-ft @ 4,800 rpm<br /><br /><br />Transmission<br />9-spd automatic<br />8-spd automatic<br /><br /><br />Fuel Economy<br />18 mpg (16 mpg city/22&#160; hwy)<br />22 mpg (20 city/25 hwy)<br /><br /><br />Also Available<br />4WD<br />360 hp 3.0-liter turbodiesel; 395 hp 5.7-liter V8 and V8 hybrid; 4WD<br /><br /><br /><strong>Specs</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Warranty<br />5 years/100,000 miles<br />3-years/36,000 miles<br /><br /><br />Max Seating Capacity<br />6<br />6<br /><br /><br />Wheelbase<br />139.8 inches<br />144.6-153.5 inches<br /><br /><br />Overall Length<br />228.2-229.5 inches<br />232.9-241.8 inches<br /><br /><br />Width<br />79.5-80.7 inches<br />82.1 inches<br /><br /><br />Height<br />75.4 -77.2 inches<br />75.4-77.6 inches<br /><br /><br />Turning Diameter<br />48.0 feet<br />46.2 feet<br /><br /><br />Headroom, Front<br />41.0 inches<br />40.9 inches<br /><br /><br />Headroom, Rear<br />40.4 inches<br />39.8 inches<br /><br /><br />Legroom, Front<br />41.8 inches<br />40.9 inches<br /><br /><br />Legroom, Rear<br />38.5 inches<br />45.2 inches<br /><br /><br />Shoulder Room, Front<br />63.3 inches<br />66.0 inches<br /><br /><br />Shoulder Room, Rear<br />63.6 inches<br />65. 7 inches<br /><br /><br />Max Payload<br />1,580 pounds<br />2,000 pounds<br /><br /><br />Max Towing<br />9,350 pounds<br />7,620 pounds<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>",0.091,0.023,0.9898,9YVugw5dUiEGhRsTMpN5aT,,

You'll have to keep your eyes peeled to see all the clues in this video. It isn't until the end that we see a quick flash of a hand on what appears to be the Z Proto's new manual shifter. In another brief moment, the video also confirms what we already suspected: the Z will feature 300ZX-inspired taillights. A few days ago, Nissan design boss Alfonso Albaisa revealed a sketch of the thin, elongated lighting elements that provide a modern take on earlier Z generations, particularly the Z32 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Once again, we can see the Nissan Z Proto's attractive silhouette. The steep roof harkens back to the current 370Z, although the overall design is more fluid. A long hood, chrome strip on the roof, and sharp body lines contribute to the more streamlined look. We can clearly see design cues that reference the Zs of yesteryear, including the rounded headlights and the Z badge mounted on the C-pillar.

What remains unclear is the powertrain. The next generation may pack a 4.0-liter V-6 as rumors of a 400Z badge would suggest. Or it could get a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 from Infiniti's Red Sport 400 models. Since the upcoming reveal is a prototype, we may have to wait some time before finding out this information.","<div><p class=""_25GXi""><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nissan has dropped a new teaser video (below) that confirms that the Nissan Z Proto, and thus likely the production version that will follow, will feature a manual transmission&#8212;as hinted in an earlier teaser.

Nissan stays ready to adjust marketing strategy to everchanging realities

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For the first time, Nissan is bringing its popular “Heisman House” to college and professional football, one of several new twists as the campaign returns for its 10th season of star-studded shenanigans. Filmed under strict social-distancing guidelines, the Heisman House spots star eight Heisman Trophy winners including Tim Tebow, Kyler Murray, Charles Woodson and Lamar Jackson and feature the all-new 2021 Rogue alongside the Nissan Sentra, refreshed TITAN and Kicks.

“Over the past six months, Nissan has pivoted multiple times to adjust to new realities, and that agility has enabled us to come up with new and entertaining ways to reach our audiences,” said Allyson Witherspoon, vice president, Marketing Communications and Media, Nissan North America. “Case in point: the ‘It’s a Heisman thing’ campaign.

“While there’s no doubt that the 2020 college football season will look different, the humor, camaraderie and excitement of the Nissan Heisman House remain relevant, perhaps even more so during this time when audiences are craving some semblance of normalcy.”

The first two spots, “ It’s Heisman Time ” and “ Bird-watching ,” begin airing on September 12. And to ensure a wide reach for the Heisman House spots, Nissan is complementing its ad dollars with placements during professional football broadcasts beginning September 14.

“With less college football this year and six of the eight Heisman winners starring in the Nissan Heisman House spots currently playing professional football, it’s a natural redirection,” Witherspoon said.

The campaign brings former Heisman Trophy winners together under one roof where they rib each other incessantly and individually prep for the season they’ve all been waiting for to get underway. Other Heisman Trophy winners featured in the campaign are Marcus Mariota, Baker Mayfield, Derrick Henry and Mark Ingram. Making its TV debut is the all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue, which has all the technology, capability and functionality to make life easier for today’s families.

With its agency partner, TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, Nissan was diligent about taking safety precautions and enforcing social distancing among cast and crew on the Heisman House set, making for a shoot unlike any other. In scenes that made it difficult for the Heisman stars to socially distance, the crew filmed them individually on a green screen piecing the segments together in post-production.

In the spot titled “Anticipation,” Tebow is driving the Rogue, Nissan’s best-selling model in the industry’s largest segment, with Murray riding shotgun. The two filmed their portions of the spot separately, each addressing their lines to a tennis ball.

The spots will run on TV across ESPN, ABC, FOX and CBS. More content will be available on Nissan’s and ESPN’s digital channels including a 3D experience at the Virtual Heisman House as well as behind-the-scenes footage and bloopers from the shoot.

Looking forward, Nissan says college and professional sporting events will remain a cornerstone of its marketing strategy.

“College sports is the largest area of Nissan’s annual media spend, and we’re committed to sharing in the excitement with customers through content they love to watch,” Witherspoon said. “Come what may, we’ll adjust and innovate as we always do.”

The Australian arm of Japanese car maker Nissan is looking to build on the name it made for itself launching the Nissan Leaf in 2012, outlining plans to launch a full electrified range locally by 2022 – and no model is off-limits. With any luck, these plans will kick off with the recently-announced Nissan Ariya which, according to Nissan Australia's managing director Stephen Lester, is high on the wish list. ""For us in Australia we have a strong feeling that this car would be perfect for our market,"" Mr Lester told CarAdvice ahead of World EV Day on September 9. ""It would make a lot of sense in that crossover segment – the most dominant segment in the market overall – as it appeals to the widest range of drivers, from those with families looking for utility, through to empty nesters."" While the status of the Ariya in Australia remains unconfirmed, CarAdvice understands that if it were to come here, the Ariya likely wouldn't arrive in showrooms until 2022, with a price point to compete with the Tesla Model 3 (which starts from $73,900 before on-road costs).

However, Mr Lester said Nissan would consider a ""basket"" of competing brands before positioning a local offering. Though the Nissan Leaf is the third most affordable all-electric car in Australia (behind the Hyundai Ioniq and the departing Renault Zoe), buyers may not necessarily benefit from entry-level pricing across Nissan's future electric offerings. ""Obviously the lower down the price band you are, the more potential people you have that can purchase your vehicle, but what is also important is that you deliver a vehicle that does what it says it's going to do,"" Mr Lester said. Regardless of whether or not the Nissan Ariya makes it to our shores, Australian consumers should expect almost a third of the brand's local portfolio to be electrified in two years' time. ""From an Australian perspective, we expect to have 30 per cent of our portfolio electrified by 2022,"" Mr Lester said, citing both full-electric options and Nissan's e-Power hybrid technology as part of this plan.

So, what kinds of electric and hybrid models are likely to debut over the next 24-or-so months? ""As far as concepts being worked on globally, there's not a segment we're not at least looking at,"" Mr Lester said. Even an electrified ute isn't off the table, although Mr Lester suggested this might be more of a task for the litany of start-ups targeting pick-up buyers with a penchant for electrification. ""I think there's no less than three brands – not mainstream automotive brands – that have been launching in that exact space,"" he said, referring to challenger brands like Rivian, Bollinger and Nikola. ""In Australia, [utes] play a very important role in the market and I have no reason to say we won't see electric utes.""

Last year, the company confirmed it will at least add a hybrid variant to the Navara ute at some point in the future, with the next-generation model. As for whether the pioneering Nissan Leaf will remain part of the portfolio, Mr Lester wasn't definitive on the compact hatchback's future in our market. ""We see EVs in all senses being the mainstay – whether or not it's specifically the Leaf as a nameplate, time will tell,"" he explained. ""To have EVs really become part of the mainstream we need more selection and more products people want to get behind the wheel of – for the vast majority of us [a car] is something you like people to see you in, it's not just a bare necessity.""

Mr Lester also shed light on how Nissan Australia plans to tackle some of the more common barriers to electric vehicle uptake in Australia – namely: higher prices, limited charging infrastructure and the ongoing debate over the green credentials of the cars themselves. ""What most industry experts say is that by 2024, or the mid 2020s, the cost of producing an electric vehicle will be equal to that of producing an ICE vehicle, and I think that still stays in our case in the market,"" Mr Lester said. ""From a production standpoint, we’d be able to price those vehicles fairly comparably."" However, he also argued the sheer amount of technology available in electric cars, along with their ability to feed power back into the grid via bi-directional charging, could come at a price premium. ""Even in today’s case it’s not fair to take a Leaf and compare it to another vehicle of a comparable size. No other vehicle on the market offers bidirectional charging, so how can I effectively price someone else’s hatch at the same price?""

On the contentious issue of Australia's largely coal-powered electricity grid, Mr Lester said there was certainly still room to improve. ""The reality is that in this country at the moment, coal is still a part of the grid, but that doesn't mean it will be forever. There's no question the government plays a huge role in that, compared to an organic movement of people,"" Mr Lester said. As for public charging infrastructure (or lack thereof)? ""We will continue to advocate for a strong improvement in that area – there's a certain ubiquity required so consumers can feel they can get a charge then they need to,"" he explained. ""But while the idea of a petrol station being on every corner has become the norm, a lot of us didn't grow up with a bowser nearby, so it's something that organically takes some time.""

Mr Lester acknowledges that while Nissan might have been first with the Leaf, the electric car market has since ballooned to include a slew of intimidating competitors – but he believes Nissan still retains its point of difference. ""Our production and engineering are what are going to differentiate us,"" he said. ""There’s no doubt that other brands will improve but competition is great, because it fuels everybody to get better and gives consumers more choice."" MORE: Everything Nissan

According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.
After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan.",20/09/2020,"By Noriyuki Suzuki and Takuma Obinata, KYODO NEWS - Sep 12, 2020 - 19:51 | All, Japan

Former Nissan Motor Co. executive Greg Kelly is confident that he can prove his innocence over alleged financial misconduct as his long-awaited trial begins next Tuesday in Tokyo -- without former boss Carlos Ghosn.

In an interview with Kyodo News, Kelly, 63, said he was ""not disappointed"" in Ghosn, who jumped bail and fled Japan in late 2019 to Lebanon, but he would like to have the former charismatic leader as a witness.

""I didn't violate any laws in Japan. This is a matter that, in my view, should have been resolved at Nissan. Nothing was ever promised to Carlos Ghosn. Nothing was ever paid to him,"" Kelly said in Tokyo a week before the trial.

""I'm confident that I'm innocent,"" said Kelly, a former Nissan representative director, who is out on bail after his arrest by Tokyo prosecutors in November 2018.

Kelly, who took the post in 2012, is accused of conspiring with Ghosn in underreporting the former boss's remuneration by around 9 billion yen ($84.8 million) over eight years through March 2018, in violation of Japan's financial instruments and exchange law. Nissan faces the same accusation as a company.

The prosecutors allege that there were deferred payments that Ghosn was to receive after his retirement, a scheme meant to avoid backlash to his high compensation.

""I would love to have him here as a witness because he could testify,"" Kelly said of Ghosn. ""This is a case about no promise and no pay. So I wish he was here.""

""But you know, in life, we all have to make our own decisions. And he made a decision he thought was best for him and his family.""

Kelly did not hide his frustration over the nearly two years that have passed since his arrest, saying he was ""snatched"" from his family in the United States. His planned neck surgery had to be delayed, and he has not seen his 9-month-old grandson.

""I don't think anybody in the world, for this kind of issue that should have been resolved at the corporate level, would want to wait two years in a country that's 6,000 miles from your family. Having to wait this long to even start a trial is very difficult,"" Kelly said.

Ghosn also faces a charge of aggravated breach of trust for his alleged misuse of Nissan funds, an accusation not leveled against Kelly.

Ghosn has claimed that his arrest was due to a plot by Nissan, which wanted to stop him from pursuing a merger with alliance partner and largest shareholder Renault SA, an arrangement the Japanese automaker feared would hurt its independence.

According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.

""It was very important for him, for people at Nissan, especially people in Japan, to have pride in Nissan, their company,"" Kelly said. ""My view of his value was based on what the global marketplace was.""

In 2010, Japan started requiring top executives to disclose their annual remuneration exceeding 100 million yen. Ghosn's compensation, according to the prosecutors, totaled around 2.4 billion yen in the business year through March 2018, months before his arrest.

Kelly, who used to serve as the head of human resources at Nissan, said his relationship with Ghosn is not as close as the media have portrayed it.

""Carlos Ghosn is not my friend. I respect him, and I like him, but he was my boss. So, I don't know his family. We didn't go out and drink wine together.""

With his wife in Tokyo, Kelly is now preparing for a trial that he said would last about four months in the United States, by reading piles of documents. The prosecution had 84 boxes of documents, and the defense team is still waiting for 90 percent of these materials.

After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan. The proceedings will be held using consecutive interpretation, not simultaneous.

""I'm a person in life that's more of an optimist,"" Kelly said when asked if the truth would win out. ""So, I would hope it would.""

After stopping during the first safety car period without changing drivers, Fujinami was able to take advantage of clear air and gain ground before handing over to de Oliveira for the run to the flag, the Brazilian moving up from 12th to sixth at the finish.

However, Kondo was later stripped of the points it scored due to a 30-second penalty for an infraction at its first pitstop, applied for having the engine running before the car had been lowered from its jacks, dropping de Oliveira and Fujinami to 20th place.

De Oliveira said the rules breach was brought to the attention of the stewards by fellow Nissan GT300 team Gainer, whose #11 car moved up to sixth place as a result of Kondo's penalty and leads the points standings.

The long-time Nissan GT500 driver described the situation as ""annoying"" and ""sad"", and vowed not to help Gainer in its championship fight as a result.

It’s a true blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, with the video showing the driver’s palm resting on top of the car’s shifter. The teaser video is shot in a way that blocks any meaningful view of the said shifter but if you turn down the speed of the playback and you’ll see just a small part of what looks like a manual shifter.

Perhaps this is Nissan’s way of hyping -or confirming- that the new Z will offer a manual option. We can’t be 100 percent sure just yet but we also can’t see why Nissan would do this in a teaser video if they didn’t plan to offer a manual transmission in the new Z.

The upcoming Nissan Z Proto is expected to be a near-production concept of the next-generation sports car, which according to some reports it will hit the market in 2021 and others claim it would launch in late 2022.

The new Nissan Z is reportedly going to be based on a heavily updated version of the 370Z’s platform and will use the company’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine, which makes 400 HP under the bonnet of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400.

The latest teaser image of the new Nissan Z also gave us a first look at the rear end design, which appears to adopt design cues from the 300ZX. The sketch shows a series of slim LED taillights and reveals more of the Z’s sloping roofline.

Set to carry on the legacy of the Z series, the model is expected to be a proper driver’s car, with a front engine, rear-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission in between.

Yep, you heard that right, as after the previous teaser that hinted the presence of a stick shift, the automaker has finally confirmed it in a new video that also shows a handbrake lever, which should earn it extra points with purists.

The 33-second long clip also reveals other details, such as the redesigned ‘Z’ logo that adorns different parts of the model, including the door sills and center console, LED headlamps and V-shaped alloy wheels wrapped in bespoke ‘Nissan Z’ tires.

You can also hear the engine firing up, which is presumably a V6, with 3.0 liters in displacement and twin turbocharging. The mill generates 400 HP and 350 pound-feet (475 Nm) of torque in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400, but the exact output of the Z Proto is currently unknown.

Nonetheless, we don’t have to wait that long to find out all the juicy secrets of the new Japanese sports car, as it will premiere on September 15, at 8:30 p.m. EDT (Sep 16, 2:30 a.m. CET), probably as a concept or pre-production prototype, with some claiming that the final model will launch in 2021 or perhaps even 2022.","<div><p id=""div-gpt-ad-3499414-6""></p><br /><p>After going into production in 2009, the 370Z endures as one of the oldest sports cars in the market.

The upcoming Nissan Magnite sub-4m compact crossover is currently undergoing an intensive testing regime to get ready for an early 2021 launch. The mini SUV which will slot below the Kicks as the company’s most affordable model in the country will be aiming to be a turnaround specialist.

Exterior and Interior Design

Thanks to leaked patent images of the production spec Nissan Magnite, we now have a better idea about the car’s design. In addition, Nissan had recently previewed the Magnite via a set of concept images. With its edgy exterior design elements and uncluttered interior layout, the crossover targets young urban audience.

The design actually originates from the Datsun Go-Cross concept which world premiered at 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. Owing to the budget brand’s poor show, the low-cost Datsun SUV failed to meet the assembly line. The Nissan Magnite is essentially a more upmarket take on the Go-Cross concept.

Platform

The Nissan Magnite SUV is underpinned by Renault-Nissan Alliance’s CMF-A+ platform which will cater to emerging market-specific products. The upcoming Nissan crossover will share its platform with the Renault Kiger which is also currently undergoing testing.

Both these products together will shoulder the responsibility of powering Renault-Nissan Alliance out of its rough patch in India. Moreover, Nissan’s future plans for India hinges on how successful the Magnite is going to be.

Powertrain

There is no official confirmation about the Nissan Magnite’s powertrain options but a 1.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine is reported to be the viable candidate. With an estimated output of 100 hp and 160 Nm of torque, the motor will be at par with the segment rivals. We expect both manual and automatic transmission options to be on offer right from day one.

With BS6 emission standards warranting expensive fixes to diesel engines, the Alliance has opted to discontinue its famed 1.5-liter dCi motor. So, like the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Nissan Magnite will be a petrol-only SUV.

Rivals and launch

In addition to Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Magnite will have to fight it out with an array of well rounded compact crossovers like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Ford EcoSport, and its own sibling, the Kiger.

Scheduled to be launched sometime in the first half of 2021, the Nissan Magnite will be heavily localized to arrive at a competitive price point. While the competition is going to be intense, the sub-4m SUV segment is also growing at a brisk rate. Will the Nissan SUV crack it?

Nissan has dropped another teaser video of the upcoming new Z sports car, and this time we can hear its engine rev and see its six-speed manual shifter.

The new Z is expected to be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that could produce up to 400 horsepower.

A concept version, called the ""Z Proto"" will be revealed on September 15.

Nissan will show us a prototype of its new Z sports car, called the Z Proto, on Tuesday next week. It'll take design cues from its predecessors—the original 240Z as well as the 300ZX of the early 1990s—and it's likely to be powered by a version of the engine found in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport. And now we know a little bit of what that engine will sound like, and that the new Z will have a glorious six-speed manual transmission (#SaveTheManuals).

Nissan

That engine is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, which produces either 300 or 400 horsepower in various versions of the Infiniti Q50 and Q60. We're not sure exactly how much power it will make in the Z, but it's possible Nissan will offer a standard model as well as a more powerful NISMO variant. And now we have confirmation that all that power will be sent rearward through a standard six-speed manual transmission.

We'll see and know more about the new Nissan Z sports car when the Z Proto makes its debut on Tuesday, September 15, and the production version should arrive sometime next year. Until then, we'll just keep listening to that twin-turbo six sing and daydream about rowing its gears ourselves.

FRAMINGHAM – Crosspoint Associates has acquired a 2.75 acre site adjacent to its Whole Foods Marketplace on Route 9 in Framingham, allowing the Newton-based developer to proceed with plans to significantly expand the upscale grocery store.

Formerly home to the Colonial Nissan auto dealership, the property includes a 19,500 square foot showroom/office/flex space.

The deal was brokered by Bernard Gibbons of the Cambridge-based Associated Brokerage Group (ABG), who represented the seller, Empire Management Corp., and procured the buyer.

“Grocery-anchored shopping centers have been one of the few bright spots for retail during this health crisis, and the acquisition of the Colonial dealership allows Crosspoint to expand the size of the store and retain its anchor tenant,” said Gibbons. “The strategic location on Route 9, coupled with the value that a Whole Foods delivers to a retail center, allowed us to achieve record pricing for this parcel.”

This spring, Crosspoint indicated to the Framingham Planning Board that if the store was not allowed to expand to conform to the Whole Foods prototype, the grocer would need to seek a new location.

The deal keeps Whole Foods in Framingham.

The acquisition of the site allows Crosspoint to expand the retail center – which currently includes a Starbucks, TD Bank, Pilates studio, a waxing salon and one vacant retail space – by 14,089 square feet to 77,249 square feet, with the Whole Foods store expanding by 7,163 square feet to 43,617 square feet.

The former Nissan dealership would be home to a mixture of new retail spaces, including a new building for Starbucks complete with a drive-thru area.

The new retail center is being designed by HFA. Boston Real Estate Advisors principal Craig A. Barker represented Crosspoint Associates in the transaction.

The City of Framingham had assessed the property at $2,925,000

2023 Nissan Z: Powertrain and Performance

Anticipated to pack a stable of 400 horses, the upcoming 400Z is sure to have the power needed to properly compete with the likes of the Toyota Supra and the Porsche 718 Cayman sports coupes. Look for the new Z to rely on a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 for motivation.

Cribbed from the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport 400 models, the engine will likely pair with either the Infinitis' seven-speed automatic transmission or a tried-and-true manual gearbox (take that, Supra). Like past Zs, power will get sent exclusively to the coupe's rear wheels.

2023 Nissan Z: Looks and Styling

Look for the new Z's styling to ride the coattails of its predecessors. As such, buyers can anticipate retro cues that evoke the original Datsun 240Z's round headlights, long hood, and stubby rear end. Even the car's badging will embrace an old-school font.

Similarly, we expect the new Z's insides to combine modern technology with design elements that give a nod toward the past. Nissan is sure to fit the car with a trio auxiliary gauges atop its dashboard.

2023 Nissan Z: On-Sale Date and Price

We anticipate the 2023 Nissan Z will reach dealerships in the United States before the end of 2022. Although Nissan will initially sell the new Z exclusively as a coupe (with a hatch to access the cargo area), it may resurrect the model's convertible body style a year or two down the line.","<div><p class=""_25GXi"">After more than a decade on the market, <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/"">the Nissan 370Z</a> is finally retiring.

While details regarding technical specs remain shrouded in mystery, Nissan does say the new Z car combines a “retro theme with modern technology” and that it “won’t disappoint.” Chances are the official reveal will technically involve a prototype given the use of “Proto” in the name, but it should be close to the real deal. The company took a similar approach in 2005 with the GT-R Proto, which looked almost the same as the production-ready R35 that arrived a couple of years later.

The fact it will be a prototype rather than an actual production model could mean Nissan is still putting the finishing touches on the 370Z successor. Connecting the dots, it might not hit the market until sometime next year, possibly as a 2022MY in the United States.","<div><p>Long overdue, but it&#8217;s finally here. Well, almost.

The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort.

What's HotThe original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car.",14/09/2020,"EDITOR'S NOTE: With Nissan slated to unveil a concept version of its next-generation Nissan Z sports car on September 15, we figured you'd enjoy a look back at its progenitor, the Datsun 240Z, from the fall 2010 issue of MotorTrend Classic.

When I was in high school in the 1970s, the Datsun Z was the machine the sports car crowd all wanted, and I was among them. Of course, I wanted mine in groovy root-beer brown metallic with aftermarket slot mags just like those on the pristine example in these photos. My muffler guy had a slick dual-exhaust system all sourced out and ready to go.

The original Datsun 240Z that broke ground here in the United States for the 1970 model year was Japan's first credible volume sports car effort. (The Toyota 2000GT was beautiful but rare and expensive.)

See all 18 photos

The Z had it all: Performance, Japanese reliability, an affordable sticker (although dealers did try to mark them up, of course), and all the right hardware. The car magazines raved about them, and so did everyone I knew who owned or was somehow able to test drive one.

Launched initially only as a two-seater, the budget Jaguar E-Type formula was clear and present: long hood, short deck, a revvy overhead-cam six, independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, a four-speed transmission, and full gauges—real sports car credentials. The 2.4-liter SOHC six was an upsized relative of Datsun's robust 2.0-liter I-4. Both are composed of an iron block with an aluminum OHC head; induction came courtesy of dual side-draft Hitachi carbs. The only trans offered in the U.S. was a four-speed manual (other markets got a five-speed, and an optional three-speed automatic showed up in 1971). Although 150 horsepower doesn't sound like much these days, it was plenty for a close-coupled sport coupe weighing around 2,400 pounds.

The interior is handsome enough and comfortable for even the tallest occupants. The switchgear is pure 1970s Japanese, a bit plasticky and the materials are not terribly robust. Dashes are often cracked and covered with a woven mat of some sort. Much of the interior trim is quilted vinyl, which is commonly recovered with carpeting; reproduction kits are available. The factory wood steering wheel is an expensive piece; cracked ones can be repaired.

The aftermarket erupted with body modifications and go-fast goodies. Many early Zs have been heavily modified. It's our suggestion to stay away from these pieces, unless that's your taste and modification is what you intend to do with the car anyway.

Many have been bobbed of their bumpers, and more than a few Chevy V-8s have found their way beneath those long Datsun hoods. It's getting harder to find unmolested, original examples. Good ones command a premium, but they're a value as opposed to trying to bring a clapper back from the dead.

We asked one owner the three most important problem issues to look for, and he said, ""Rust, rust, and rust."" The factory's rustproofing efforts were so-so, and these cars trap water in all kinds of places. The bases of the tailgates rust out, plus the usual spots like doorsills, rocker panels, around the windshields, and the edges of the fenders. Pay more for a rust-free example; it'll be cheaper and nicer in the end. Carburetor linkages can be finicky, and fuse blocks are known to melt down. Modified, overly stiff suspensions can cause cracks in the frame, especially near suspension mounting points.

Z engines love frequent oil changes and a fresh 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water to make sure the iron block and alloy head don't develop corrosion in the cooling system. The shifter is a bit sloppy in its gates, although the trans and clutch are relatively long-lived items if the car hasn't been abused. Clunky suspensions indicate worn bushings, although replacement parts are plentiful.

Back to rust for a moment. Have the car checked to ensure its suspension pickup and mounting points are solid and not rusted away. Installing new shocks, fresh bushings, and wheel bearings in a high-mile car will usually accomplish wonders for ride, handling, and running noise reduction.

Avoid cars that have been crashed and poorly repaired or cheaply repainted. The Z has many subtle body lines, and they often get lost in translation if the car has been oversanded or too-thickly painted.

Factory rolling stock on early 240Zs consisted of 5.5-inch steel wheels with hubcaps. Junkyards were filled with them in the 1970s, although finding clean originals is a little tougher today. Most cars have had a swap to wider, aftermarket rims by now. No problem, but don't go crazy on width; 7.0 inches seems a comfortable maximum so as not to overstress the suspension, increase the steering effort too much, wear the steering system, and/or kill the ride.

Most of the rest of the usual ""buying an old sports car"" rules apply: Find an expert to give the car you're looking at a thorough inspection, plan on some recommissioning expenses, drive, and enjoy. Even though it is not strictly original, many owners recommend installing a strut tower brace in the engine compartment, which connects the front shock towers and adds structural rigidity to the front part of the frame.

These Datsuns were successful race cars, too. Peter Brock's BRE team tore up the West Coast Sports Car Club of America events at the wheel of a Z, and one P.L. Newman, driving for Bob Sharp Racing in Connecticut, did the same on the right coast, as well. Sharp himself won two SCCA national titles aboard Zs.

A tight, crisp 240 still defines the Datsun Z-car experience, and they're sure to be most collectible in the future. Any 240Z in good fettle is great fun and should be a drivable weekend sports car.

Datsun Z: Through the Years

1971 The transmission and rear differential were mildly revised. Optional automatic transmission offered.

1972 Compression ratio was reduced on U.S. models.

1973 The engine and intake systems further revised to meet emissions requirements, and the Z grew larger, rubber-capped bumpers to meet the new crash specs.

1974 The engine was enlarged to 2.6 liters, and the car became the 260Z for one year only. It's still substantially the same piece, but most collectors prefer the more ""pure,"" pre-crash bumper 240s. A new 2+2 body style was offered at the same time.

1975 Another bump in displacement begat the 280Z. This stretched out the original Z's body shape and platform through the 1978 model year. Some of the performance losses were regained via the displacement bump and the addition of fuel injection (280Z only), but the 260s and 280s are heavier and don't feel as spirited and lithe as the first-generation Z.

1979 The original Z is redesigned and renamed the 280ZX. The new car is larger, roomier, and relies more on electronics. T-tops were also offered, although they tended to leak and reduced the chassis structural rigidity. The two-seat and 2+2 body styles continue, running an updated version of the fuel injected 2.8-liter engine that made its debut on the 280Z. The original Zs remain the most highly sought among them, but there is a small but growing groundswell of collector interest in 280ZXs.

Special Datsun Z Models

During the Z-car's production hiatus, Nissan offered a program where it acquired solid 240Zs and contracted with an independent Southern California specialist called Pierre Z to restore them. In 1997, you could buy one through a Nissan dealer; they're identified by a small plaque on the console, just aft of the shifter. The cars were restored to near factory original condition using OEM parts and cost $25,000- $29,000. Or you could bring Nissan your Z, and it would put it through the process. Either way, you got a nearly new 25-year-old car backed by Nissan, and they bring strong prices today if maintained and still in good shape.

What's Hot

The original Z still feels relevant and is fun to drive as a sports car. A good supply of OEM and aftermarket parts are available, and the cars are relatively straightforward to work on. There are several parts companies and shops that specialize in Zs.

What's Not

Many cars have been highly modified, ridden hard, and put away wet (and rusty). Inspect carefully and seek out solid examples. Better cars will cost more up front and be less costly and more enjoyable to own in the long run.

Hot Tip

Pay more if you need to for a car in top condition; you'll save money in the long run.

Avoid

Rusty, previously crashed (hard), and heavily modified cars with engine swap.

Most Collectible Datsun Z

Clean, stock, original 1970 240Z.

Best Performer

Ditto.

Best Daily Driver Datsun Z

Any year 240 works well for moderate duty, although they don't get great fuel mileage—something to consider if you plan to use your 240Z as a daily runner. The '73 model's drivability suffered given revised emissions controls. Some prefer the later 280Z as an everyday driver because the larger displacement and the addition of fuel injection improved cold starts and drivability.

Bottom Line

A Japanese sports car icon then and today, and respected as a classic from a country that doesn't yet have many. Buy the best one you can find and afford. Also makes a great weekend club racer, and minor mods can enhance performance substantially.

Limited edition to farewell R35 supercar ahead of R36 series due in 2023: report,"Nissan is reportedly preparing a swansong for the R35 GT-R, with a limited edition to see the supercar off ahead of its R36 successor.
Best Car Web claims the R35’s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.
Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.
These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.
As reported, Nissan is considering electrifying the GT-R by including a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the R36, similar to what was used in its ill-fated GT-R LM Nismo prototype from 2015.",15/09/2020,"Nissan is reportedly preparing a swansong for the R35 GT-R, with a limited edition to see the supercar off ahead of its R36 successor.

Best Car Web claims the R35’s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.

According to the Japanese publication, the Final will be a collector’s items, with only about 20 units to be up for grabs with hefty price tags around the 40 million yen ($AU518,360) mark.

Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.

The Japanese publication also reports the Final’s engine will be based on that of the GT-R GT3 racecar, which suggests it could be the same unit used in the GT-R50 by Italdesign, a million-dollar-plus limited edition that marked the 50th anniversary of the nameplate.

In the GT-R50 by Italdesign, the GT-R's engine was upgraded with competition-spec turbochargers, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition and revised intake and exhaust systems.

These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.

As reported, Nissan is considering electrifying the GT-R by including a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the R36, similar to what was used in its ill-fated GT-R LM Nismo prototype from 2015.

The KERS system in the GT-R LM racecar fed energy to a pair of flywheels from the front brakes, and was able to send that energy to both the front and rear axles via independent driveshafts.","<div><p>Nissan is reportedly preparing a swansong for the R35 GT-R, with a limited edition to see the supercar off ahead of its R36 successor.</p><p><a href=""https://bestcarweb.jp/news/scoop/193233"" target=""_blank"">Best Car Web</a> claims the R35&#8217;s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.</p><p>According to the Japanese publication, the Final will be a collector&#8217;s items, with only about 20 units to be up for grabs&#160;with hefty price tags around the 40 million yen ($AU518,360) mark.</p><p>Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.</p><p>The Japanese publication also reports the Final&#8217;s engine will be based on that of the GT-R GT3 racecar, which suggests it could be the same unit used in the GT-R50 by Italdesign, a million-dollar-plus limited edition that marked the 50th anniversary of the nameplate.</p><p>In the GT-R50 by Italdesign, the <a href=""/nissan/gt-r"">GT-R's</a> engine was upgraded with competition-spec <a href=""/car-advice/what-is-a-turbocharger-36401"">turbochargers</a>, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition and revised intake and exhaust systems.</p><p>These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.</p><p>As reported, <a href=""/nissan"">Nissan</a> is considering electrifying the GT-R by including a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the R36, similar to what was used in its ill-fated GT-R LM Nismo prototype from 2015.</p><p>The KERS system in the GT-R LM racecar fed energy to a pair of flywheels from the front brakes, and was able to send that energy to both the front and rear axles via independent driveshafts.</p></div>",0.067,0.027000000000000003,0.9081,xSzAFyGrvSDaammTNzQFoA,,

The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn Tuesday when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former aide Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for a businessman once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But lost in the small print was the same-day arrest of Kelly, and with Ghosn now in Lebanon as an international fugitive after jumping bail and fleeing Japan last year the American lawyer is the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

He faces a single charge -- conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 Tuesday and is out on bail living in an aparftment in Tokyo, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question fraught with technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Vast amounts of evidence

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast trove of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted -- despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.

The 500,000th Leaf came off the production line in Magnetic Red paint and is making its way to a customer in Norway. It was produced at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, where 175,000 of the electric cars have been manufactured since 2013.

The Leaf has been around for a decade now, winning several accolades during its tenure on the world’s roads, including World Car of the Year 2011, as well as Car of the Year in Europe and Japan in the same year. Until earlier this year it was the bestselling electric car ever, before being surpassed by the Tesla Model 3, which sold 300,000 units in 2019 alone.

According to Nissan, Leaf owners have driven 14.8bn “clear air kilometres” (9.2bn zero emission miles) since 2010, in the process preventing 2.4bn kg of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere from exhausts.

The Sunderland plant that produced the 500,000th Leaf has had a tumultuous time of late, being spared from closure as part of streamlining plans earlier this year. However, Nissan Boss Ashwani Gupta said that the factory, the UK’s biggest car making plant, could still be in jeopardy due to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

The current version of the Leaf comes with two range options: the standard 40kWh battery, designed for city driving, comes with an estimated 168-mile range, whereas the e+, with a 62kWh battery designed for a longer commute, is rated at 239 miles on a single charge. The basic Acenta spec starts at £26,485.

Although competition to the Leaf was comparatively scarce 10 years ago, the Leaf now acts as the veteran in a rapidly expanding sector of the EV market. Hatchbacks such as the VW ID.3, the Mini Electric and the Peugeot e-208 all vie for the same customers, but now in its second generation, the Leaf can claimed to be a tried and tested family favourite.

Nissan introduced another electric car to its line-up earlier this year in the form of the Ariya, a pure-electric SUV with a claimed range of 310 miles. Nissan previously said that it wanted an eight-strong lineup of electric cars by 2022.

Nissan’s head of electric passenger cars, Helen Perry, said that the company believes people want to make a positive environmental change in their driving habits after seeing air pollution drop over the course of the coronavirus lockdown.

She said: “Consumers have seen what cleaner air and reduced noise pollution feel like during lockdowns,” said Perry. “Now more than ever, they’re looking to take positive steps towards a more sustainable future and the Nissan Leaf contributes to this effort.”

Nissan has a long history of selling sports cars and the GT-R does deserve a hall of fame for what it has really been over the years without much changes. The 370Z, on the other hand, is getting a major overhaul as a concept signalling the arrival of a production model is getting unveiled in the coming weeks.

The enthusiasts of the Nissan GT-R though may have to wait a little longer than expected. According to a Japanese magazine, the next-generation Nissan GT-R is only arriving in 2023. The famed Godzilla will be exiting with a bang though as a commemorative Final Edition will be launched in 2022 and it will reportedly produce a maximum power output of 710 horsepower.

Underlining its exclusivity, Nissan will limit the production of the Final Edition to just 20 units. The GT-R R35’s Final Edition is said to use the same engine as the GT-R50 by Italdesign and it generates a peak torque of 750 Nm. It is powered by a 3.8-litre twin turbocharged V6 engine with several performance upgrades.

The GT-R50 by Italdesign is tuned by Nismo and it uses turbos from GT3 version of the GT-R used on race tracks. It also boasts larger intercoolers. It aids in increased flow in fuel injectors while the six-speed dual clutch automatic transmission and other components have also been upgraded to meet the desired specifications.

The report went on to say that the GT-R R35 Final Edition will cost around 40 million yen (Rs. 2.76 crore) – costlier than the GT-R Nismo but far lesser than the GT-R50 that costs more than a million. Bear in mind, these are just speculations currently but bringing up a Final Edition only makes sense for a car of GT-R iconic status.

As for the next-gen R36 model, reports indicate that the chassis will be adaptable to multiple powertrains, as an all-electric version or a hybrid variant is highly possible using kinetic energy recovery system borrowed from GT-R LM Nismo race car.","<div><img width=""1068"" height=""695"" class=""entry-thumb"" src=""https://gaadiwaadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nissan-gt-r-1-1068x695.jpg"" alt=""nissan gt-r-1"" title=""nissan gt-r-1""><p class=""td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_top td_uid_2_5f6035d958458_rand td_block_template_1 ""><br /> <br /></p><br /><br />   <br /><br /><p class=""gaadi-before-content"" id=""gaadi-1459542553""> <br /> <br /> <br /></p><h2>Nissan GT-R Final Edition will have its production limited to approximately 20 units and it will reportedly launch in 2022 using GT-R50 by Italidesign&#8217;s upgraded V6 powertrain</h2><br /><p>Nissan has a long history of selling sports cars and the GT-R does deserve a hall of fame for what it has really been over the years without much changes.

We’ve already said that Nissan hasn’t left itself much time to squeeze in the de riguer new car teaser campaign for the ‘Z-Proto‘. But the Japanese manufacturer is damn well trying - the titbits of information are coming thick and fast ahead of the concept’s 16 September reveal. We’ve already seen Nissan vice president of design Alfonso Albaisa show a design sketch of the car’s 300ZX-like rear end, and a couple of days ago there was yet another teaser we ignored since it didn’t really reveal anything new. This latest one for the Z-Proto - a concept which previews the 370Z-replacing ‘400Z’ - is a little more significant, however.

Expect the tyre lettering to disappear when the production version arrives...

We get a clear shot of the centre console, revealing a manual gearbox. As a bonus, we can also see a manual handbrake - remember those? Meanwhile, up and to the right, there’s what looks to be a button to activate an auto rev-matching feature, as also found in the 370Z. There are some brief shots of the exterior as a bonus, giving a glimpse of the coupe’s wheels. Want to buy a Nissan?

The 30-second clip gives us the opportunity to see the revised Z logo and check out those alloy wheels with a five double-spoke design and Z-branded brake calipers lurking from behind. In case you’re not sure what sort of car you’re looking at, the tires have prominent Nissan and Z lettering on the sidewall that might remain a prototype-only affair.

We also get to hear the roar of the engine, presumably a V6. It’s said to use a twin-turbo 3.0-liter adapted from the Infiniti Q60 Red Sport 400 where it makes 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) of torque, but that remains to be seen. For what it’s worth, Nissan says the Z Proto will be “powerful,” not to mention “iconic” and “retro” as per the video’s description on YouTube.

With still a few days left until the much-awaited debut, we have a feeling Nissan has at least one more teaser prepared for its new rear-wheel-drive coupe.","<div><p>Next Tuesday, September 15 at 8:30 PM EDT, the wraps are finally going to come off the new Z sports car.

Not only that, but Nissan has been kind enough to show a bit of the taillights, which will take after those of the 300ZX (Z32).</p><br />    <p class=""content-header""><br />        <h3 class=""mbn"">Gallery: Nissan Z Proto teasers</h3><br />    </p><br /><br />                <br />        <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/"" class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-main-photo-box""><br />                <br />                     <br />                     <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                <br />            </a><br />                        <p class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-count""><p class=""value"">15</p> <p class=""label"">Photos</p></p><br />                    <span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177553/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_2.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177551/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_3.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177554/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_4.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177552/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_5.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177550/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5172004/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><p>The 30-second clip gives us the opportunity to see the <a href=""https://www.motor1.com/news/405136/new-nissan-z-logos/"">revised Z logo</a> and check out those alloy wheels with a five double-spoke design and Z-branded brake calipers lurking from behind.

219,219,219,https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nissan-delays-new-qashqais-uk-production-start-more-6-months-report-says,Nissan delays new Qashqai's UK production start,"Nissan has delayed the start of European production of its new Qashqai for more than six months, according to a report.
Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.
Sunderland will become Nissan’s only European plant after the brand shuts its Barcelona factory at the end of the year.
Nissan had planned to shift production of the new generation of the X-Trail midsize SUV to Sunderland but reversed that last year in a decision that was partly interpreted as a lack of confidence in the UK as a production location.
Despite the changes, Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told the French newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Monday the Sunderland plant ""is the best performing of all the Nissan sites.",07/09/2020,"Nissan has delayed the start of European production of its new Qashqai for more than six months, according to a report.

Nissan was scheduled to start building the third generation of its best-selling compact SUV at its plant in Sunderland, England, in October, but now production will not start until ""after April 2021,"" two people told the Financial Times newspaper.

The delay is largely due to the coronavirus crisis, the report said.

One source told the newspaper that there is a benefit to the delay, which is that it should give Nissan better visibility of the UK's trade relationship with the European Union, which is currently being negotiated following Brexit. The existing agreement expires at the beginning of 2021.

""I don’t think anyone is upset that COVID has pushed it back,"" the source said.

The downside is the delay in replacing Nissan’s top-seller in Europe. The Qashqai has already been losing ground against rivals in the key compact SUV segment, which it has traditionally led.

July sales of the Qashqai fell 27 percent to 13,128, well behind the segment-leading Volkswagen Tiguan at 21,397 and only fractionally ahead of the Peugeot 3008 at 12,699 and the Toyota C-HR at 11,964, figures from market research JATO Dynamics show.

The delay is also a blow to workers at the Sunderland plant, which has been affected by a series of job cuts related both to the slump in demand due to the coronavirus lockdowns and Nissan’s repositioning of the brand in Europe that calls for fewer but more profitable sales.

Nissan eliminated a third shift at the plant last year and does not plan to reinstate it, despite rising demand for the new Juke small SUV made there. The automaker said there was no plan to remove the Qashqai from the plant, despite the company’s warning earlier this year that Sunderland would be ""unsustainable"" if the UK and EU failed to reach a free trade deal, which remains possible given the lack of progress in the negotiations.

""Preparations in Sunderland continue for the launch of the new Qashqai, which represents a 400 million pound (445 million euro) investment in the plant,"" a spokesman told Automotive News Europe. ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

220,220,220,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/Former-Nissan-executive-Greg-Kelly-pleads-not-guilty-in-court,Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly pleads not guilty in court,"TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.
In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.
The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.
The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court.
As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.

The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.

In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.

The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year. The amount paid to Ghosn was allegedly underreported by 9.1 billion yen ($85.8 million) over eight years.

Nissan was also charged as a corporation for violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, to which the automaker pleaded guilty in Tuesday's hearing.

The biggest issue in the trial is whether money classified as ""unpaid remuneration"" actually exists.

The defense team for Kelly, a former representative director, claims the remuneration in question was not executive compensation, as it was planned to reward Ghosn for his services to Nissan after his retirement.

Kelly's defense maintains that even if there was an obligation to report the alleged remuneration, he cannot be held criminally responsible simply because of not reporting payment.

Two Nissan whistleblowers -- a former head of the company's secretary's office and a former company executive who is a foreign national -- previously reached plea bargains with the Special Investigation Department of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office.

But Kelly's defense team is poised to question the deals, claiming that the circumstances of how it was negotiated are unclear.

Prosecutors point out that the information disclosure system concerning executive remuneration of 100 million yen or more, which was introduced from the fiscal year ended March 2010, triggered an investigation leading to the scandal.

Ghosn had received more than 1 billion yen in annual remuneration, an amount he wanted to remain private, which lead him to allegedly order Kelly and other aides to find ways to avoid reporting part of the money.

According to the indictment, Kelly conspired with Ghosn to understate Ghosn's executive remuneration by a total of 9.1 billion yen in Nissan's annual securities reports from the fiscal year ended March 2011 to March 2018.

The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.

More than 10 people -- including former Nissan President Hiroto Saikawa as well as the two Nissan executives who reached a plea bargain -- are expected to testify. No dates have been set yet for closing arguments or a ruling.

The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court. It begins with Kelly's arraignment, in which the presiding judge questions the defendant.

Kelly, who is a licensed U.S. attorney, joined Nissan through the company's North America unit and became an executive managing officer in 2008. As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office. He was promoted to representative director in 2012.

Kelly retained that position after he returned to the U.S. in 2015 until he was arrested in November 2018.

Since being released on bail in late December 2018, Kelly has been preparing for trial in the hope of finishing it as soon as possible due to a chronic health issue involving his neck.

He has already appeared for the pretrial arrangement proceeding, which was held behind closed doors. Reports say he grew visibly irritated over the slow pace of the proceedings.

Ghosn, who prosecutors allege to be the lead figure in the case, fled Japan by hiding in a box that was subsequently loaded onto a private jet and flown to Lebanon via Turkey. According to sources close to the situation, Kelly appeared surprised at the news of Ghosn's escape, saying he was not aware of it.

At a Beirut news conference he called in early January, Ghosn said Kelly was criminally charged because he refused to participate in what Ghosn described as a ""suspicious"" plea-bargaining agreement, unlike the two other Nissan executives who did.","<div><p>TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.</p><p>The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.</p><p>In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.</p><p class=""ads__upper-inline-container""></p><p>The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year.

It’s been a couple of months since Nissan unveiled the Magnite sub-4m SUV in concept form and we’ve only gotten glimpses of the production-spec model testing in extensive camouflage in India. Well now, leaked patent images reveal more on what to expect from the production-spec Magnite which isn’t too different from the concept. It’s slated to launch in 2021.

On the outside, the Magnite retains most of the concept’s bold design elements, especially at the front with a large single-piece front grille, sculpted hood, sharp headlights, and ‘L’ shaped LED DRLs. But once you get towards the overall silhouette, that’s where the differences lie. The SUV has a lower ride height than the concept which featured large fancy wheels. Also, the cladding has been slightly toned down. At the rear, the wraparound tail lights and integrated roof spoiler are retained with the bumper and cladding cleaner than the concept. It shares its CMF-A+ platform with the upcoming Renault Kiger sub-4m SUV.

The interiors are yet to be revealed but the concept showcases a minimalistic yet funky layout. It’s also set to be loaded with features such as cruise control, 360-degree camera and connected car tech. Expect more bits such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, climate control, and maybe even a sunroof. Safety kit could include around four airbags, ABS with EBD, and electronic stability control.

Under the hood, the Magnite could be powered by a 100PS 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 72PS 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine seen in the Renault Triber. A standard manual gearbox and a CVT option for the turbo-petrol motor could be the gearbox options on offer.

The Nissan Magnite is likely to retail from Rs 5.5 lakh onwards. It will take on the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport and Mahindra XUV300. There’s more competition on the way from the upcoming Kia Sonet, sibling Renault Kiger, and Toyota Urban Cruiser.

Maxime Bouladier-L’Écuyer, a 32-year-old drag racer and top-speed runner, was trying to set a Canadian top speed record this past weekend at a RaceTheHalf event on an airport circuit near Maniwaki, Quebec.

His car of choice, the OB Prestige Auto Nissan GT-R nicknamed the Alpha Queen, is reputed to pump out nearly 3,300 horsepower at the crankshaft – it’s actually been measured to boast 2,842 hp at the wheels – an incredible feat made possible only because the car’s builders, Chicago’s AMS Performance, have somehow managed to find a way to pump in 77 psi of boost without blowing the twin-turbo V6 to smithereens.

More importantly, certainly for Bouladier-L’Écuyer considering the weekend’s denouement, the Alpha Queen also has a fully NHRA-approved roll cage. So when the AMS Performance Nissan’s chute failed to open – after he had set a Canadian record of 372 km/h, mind you – it tumbled off the end of the half-mile track, ending up on its roof, bodywork severely crumpled and its great honking turbochargers torn asunder.

[UPDATE: The car’s builders, AMS Performance, have since determined that the chutes functioned correctly, but that the driver failed to activate them at the proper time.]

But as its owner, Olivier Benloulou, founder of the Ideal Protein supplement supplier, said, “The car did its job. It won the race. More importantly, it saved the life of our driver.”

“It’s that security cage that made the difference. Without it, the car would have been pulverized into pieces,” he added, not really needing to note how much more serious Bouladier-L’Écuyer’s non-life-threatening injuries might have been without the welded-up high-strength steel bars.

According to the report from Best Car Web cited by Motor1, the next GT-R is expected to arrive in 2023.

Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R.",10/09/2020,"A new report out of Japan suggests that the Nissan GT-R, aka Godzilla, will be bowing out the opposite of gracefully with a high-zoot model that will mark the end of this generation.

That same report suggests it will be a bit before any replacement for the flagship performance car will reach the market.

According to the report from Best Car Web cited by Motor1, the next GT-R is expected to arrive in 2023. That means the current car will say goodnight in 2022 with a limited-edition model, again according to the report. If this is true, just 20 units will be produced, all making 710 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque, using the engine from the Italdesign GT-R50. That 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 was massaged by NISMO and the turbos themselves came from the GT3-class GT-R race car.

The intercoolers are larger, the fuel injectors are high-flow, and the six-speed dual-clutch automatic gets beefed up to handle the power.

This car, should it arrive as described, won’t be cheap. Motor1 pegs the car at around $380,000, given Best Car Web’s estimate of much yen this vehicle will cost in Japan and current exchange rates. Those rates will change between now and 2022, of course. Regardless, it’s likely that this rumored car will cost quite a bit more than the 2021 Nissan GT-R NISMO and its $210,740 price tag. That said, the Italdesign car is worth a cool million, so in a sense, you’d be getting that powertrain for a relative bargain.

If the report is true, that is. Speculative reporting on product always requires a bit of skepticism (yes, I know we’re reporting on it, too) for whatever reason. Automakers change plans, sources are wrong, et cetera. It’s also worth noting that the link that takes you to BCW now is all about Subaru, meaning either Motor1 grabbed the wrong link or the piece has been updated.

Still, it’s not unreasonable that Nissan would want to end the R35’s run with something special, or even more special than the current GT-R. Especially as the current car will be a decade and a half old by 2022.

There’s a lot of anticipation for the next GT-R, but the current one could make some waves on the way out the door.

Still, prototypes of the 2021 Nissan Qashqai / Rogue Sport have been spotted in public throughout the summer.
“Preparations continue for the launch of the new Qashqai in Sunderland, which represents a £400 million investment in the plant,” said Nissan in a statement sent to Autocar.

“We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months,” added the Japanese carmaker.

According to the FT, this delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered development and changed the company’s priorities. The delay could also give Nissan more time to figure out what to do in case Britain doesn’t secure a post-Brexit deal with the European Union.

Two thirds of the 500,000 cars produced by Nissan in Sunderland annually are Qashqai crossovers.

As for what we may expect from a visual standpoint, the next-gen Qashqai / Rogue Sport will feature similar proportions to its predecessor and will adopt Nissan’s latest design language, meaning a more angular aesthetic, as seen on the latest Juke.

We can also expect a modern dashboard design, with a larger infotainment display and upgraded safety tech.

Some of us instead have to wait for depreciation to take its toll, and that’s where early examples of the second-generation Nissan Leaf come in.

Here’s a car that provides all of the practicality of a family hatchback and plenty of modern safety technology, and since the Leaf remains one of the most popular EVs, there are loads of second-hand examples for sale.

You can find a well-specified, mid-range 2018 Leaf for £20,000 or so – a substantial saving of around £7000 compared with the list price of a new one.

There are two motor/battery combinations: the standard Leaf uses a 40kWh pack and a 148bhp motor, while the pricier Leaf e+ gets a 62kWh pack and a 214bhp motor.

The regular model has a 0-60mph time of around 8.0sec, making it much nippier than conventionally powered rivals. And in the Leaf e+, you actually need to be a bit gentle with your right foot when accelerating out of junctions, otherwise you’ll spin its front wheels.

There’s a choice of trims, but entry-level Visia is best avoided – unless you’re a fan of hair shirts. In fact, that model was dropped shortly after launch, because most buyers went for the next step up, Acenta, to get 16in alloy wheels, blindspot monitoring, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, a reversing camera and a 7.0in touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

Arrive at a corner and the Leaf remains fluent, thanks to little body lean and well-weighted steering. Grip is good too, and while the handling won’t inspire you, it’s reassuringly safe and secure. The ride comfort is generally very good as well, with only larger bumps catching out the Leaf.

In terms of refinement, the rival Volkswagen e-Golf is better, but the Leaf still impresses. Obviously, there’s no engine noise to disturb the calm, but a little bit of wind noise and road noise do make their presence known, while the suspension transmits the odd clunk.","<div><p>Not everyone can afford a pricey new electric car, no matter how much less it would cost to fuel.

This new dark image hints at the sports car’s overall width and its light signature at the front. Judging from what we are able to see so far, our exclusive rendering seems to be quite close to the real deal but, of course, we’ll have to wait one more day to make the final judgment.

At this point, it’s not completely clear whether the new Z car will be a production model or, rather, a near-production concept. We expect it to be very close to the final production form of the 370Z’s successor but the said coupe probably won’t hit the market for another 6 to 12 months from now.

Under the hood, the Z Proto will most likely get a version of Nissan’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine. If we have to be completely accurate, it’s Infiniti’s 3.0 V6 we are talking about, which is available with up to 400 horsepower (298 kilowatts) and 350 pound-feet (475 Newton-meters) in the Red Sport 400 models. The good news is a six-speed manual gearbox will be offered alongside a seven-speed automatic.

We are not completely sure there won’t be yet another teaser before the big debut tomorrow. If it arrives, we are here to share it with you. If not, make sure to tune in tomorrow, September 15, at 8:30 PM EDT for the live broadcast of the Z Proto’s premiere.","<div><p>Of course, there&#8217;s yet another <a href=""https://www.motor1.com/news/443355/nissan-z-proto-manual-gearbox/"">teaser</a> with the upcoming new sports car from <a href=""https://www.motor1.com/nissan/"">Nissan</a>.

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault will develop and assemble the next generation of partner Nissan’s Micra models, a senior executive at the Japanese firm said, as the two companies try to reboot their alliance with tighter cooperation in production.

Ashwani Gupta, Nissan’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with France’s Le Monde newspaper published on Monday that the Micra plan was an example of their “leader-follower” strategy, with one firm taking the lead on certain car types.

Nissan Micra models are already assembled at Renault’s Flins factory in France, although that site is set to be turned over to recycling activities around 2024, when the life cycle of the car ranges made there expires.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

Both struggling financially, Renault and Nissan have cleared the decks of old managers and outlined joint cost-saving plans as they try to move on from a scandal surrounding former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: Did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen (US$87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

""I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG""

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Kelly is accused of conspiring to under-report money promised to Ghosn after retirement, an accusation he denies AFP/Behrouz MEHRI

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win more than 99 per cent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

DEFENCE REMAINS CONFIDENT

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

The fact that he was able to resign without facing prosecution has been cited by Ghosn as evidence of what he claims is a biased justice system.

The former auto chief has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.","<div><p>TOKYO: The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo.</p><p>Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p></p><br />     <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-outstream-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.</p><p>And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.</p><p></p><br />            <img class=""picture__image lazyload"" alt=""Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019""><br />            <br />                    <br /><br />Ghosn remains at large in Lebanon, where he fled after jumping bail in Japan in December 2019 AFP/Behrouz MEHRI<br />            <br />    <p>The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.</p><p></p><br />    <br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-desktop-news-story""></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p class=""advertisement__title"">Advertisement</p><br /><p class=""advertisement__container"" id=""ad-imu1-mobile-news-story""></p><br /><br /><p>Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing.

One of the most valuable cars Walker owned is an R34-generation Skyline GT-4 V-Spec that’s among just a handful in the United States.

Taking to YouTube, a man by the name of Craig Lieberman discusses the rare R34 GT-R that Walker used to own – and it has a very interesting history.

Lieberman was a technical advisor for the Fast & Furious franchise and introduced Walker to the GT-R. Back in the day, a handful of R34 models were imported to the U.S. by a company called MotoRex. They were kind enough to loan Walker an R34 and, before long, the actor fell in love with the car and quickly purchased one for himself.

Walker’s former R34 is a V-Spec model in Sonic Silver. Interestingly, Walker didn’t keep it for that long and decided to sell it and buy a white V-Spec II model instead.

That's exactly the amount of reading that it took for me to figure out that Matt Ashby is about as true a car enthusiast as anyone will ever be. When you ask someone to help tell the story of their car, you get wildly varied responses. Most people will tell you the specs of their build, maybe tossing in a little excerpt on how they got the car. Sometimes, you'll just get a cold listing of all the parts they've used. Other times, it's a story about the inspiration for their build with very little specifics. Usually they won't dive headfirst into their entire automotive history, though Matt certainly did, and I'm very glad to have listened to his full story firsthand.

Photo 17/17 | JDM S13 Nissan Silvia Wears Latest Pandem Widebody Kit View Photo Gallery (17) Photos

The context into the start of his automotive obsession very much reminds me of myself, my circle of friends and so many of our peers. Just like us, he grew up on magazines like Super Street, anxiously awaiting a new issue, only to flip through it and start all over again. He was immediately hooked on the Fast and the Furious franchise and chose an EK Honda Civic hatchback as his first build. From the one picture I saw, I wouldn't be surprised to pick up an old magazine and see his Civic published in all of its early 2000s glory.

Matt moved on from the Honda scene and got into Euros, some hot rods and even trucks. His resume is quite impressive in the truck world, including a 2017 Ford Super Duty that was featured in the RBP (Rolling Big Power) SEMA booth. If you're picturing a typical SEMA ""BroDozer"" in your head, you're almost correct; the big difference being that his is the kind that's built right. He's a stickler for the details and it shows. When the time came to switch gears back into Japanese cars, he dug deep into his past and drew inspiration from '90s and '00s tuner magazines. It's no surprise that he landed on an S-chassis Nissan, and what better platform than a real JDM S13 Silvia.

This '93 Nissan Silvia Club K's was sourced from importing specialist Driver Motorsports and Matt got to work immediately. It's not an easy task to make an S13 unique these days, so he spent countless hours searching the internet for ideas, finally landing on Hikaru Taguchi's Moontech Silvia as his main inspiration. Showcased at the Tokyo Auto Salon earlier this year, the S13 was one of only a few to sport the Pandem V3 kit at the time. Once Matt decided that this was the look he wanted, he started the monumental task of sourcing the kit. Turns out eBay ended up being the place to find one. The seller assured him that it was authentic and even ended up driving halfway across the country to deliver it. Once he met the seller, Tatsuro Watanabe of HPI Racing, there was no question it was in fact, legit.

The commanding exterior feature of Matt's S13 is the Pandem kit. The matching ducktail and rear wing fit right in with the Origin Lab carbon roof spoiler, carrying that signature aggressive style to the back of the car. Keeping with the carbon accents, he reached out to Bomex and got a set of side mirrors and a front grille made in carbon to match. All of the bodywork is bolted together with burnt titanium hardware from Dress Up Bolts and draped in a two-tone white and purple paint scheme. There's also that livery, made up of a few different layers and inspired by the '90s graphics from Advan and HKS.

If the Pandem kit wasn't enough to set this S-chassis apart, the wheels should seal the deal. When Matt picked up the kit, he knew the matching Pandem 6666 wheels were something he just had to get his hands on, but he couldn't figure out who actually sold or manufactured them. After searching around and coming up short, he reached out to Tatsuro. Turns out, he had a set available, spec'd in 18x9.5"" front, 18x11"" -rear, that would fit the S13 perfectly. Not only that, those massive fenders allow room for a set of 265- and 285-series Federal tires that give the Silvia just enough meat to look functional but not so much that it takes away from the hunkered down stance.

Matt went with a set of Fortune Auto coilovers to tighten up the handling and dial in the ride height. Fortune's air piston lift system was added to help alleviate the stress that comes with an expensive front lip and a lowered car. The S13 has a host of adjustable suspension components from GKTECH and ISR to keep the car planted when driven to the limit, and controllable when sliding around for fun. For a bit more stopping force, 300ZX brakes were retrofitted up front along with StopTech rotors and pads.

The engine is the original 205hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged Red Top SR20DET that features some choice JDM bolt-ons like the GReddy front mount intercooler, Blitz downpipe and HKS blow-off valve, intake and exhaust. Like any good project car, Matt certainly isn't finished with this one. He's looking to pull the motor, clean it up, re-wire, and put just enough upgrades to bring him up to the 300whp mark.

Inside is relatively stock compared to the rest of the car. Matt cites this as an area that will see a bit more attention as the build progresses. For now, it has some S14 seats, a DND Interiors steering wheel, as well as Cusco e-brake and shift boots in matching purple stitching. In addition, there's is a GKTECH carbon fiber gauge pod housing a GReddy boost gauge, and a Likewise shift knob and drift button on the handbrake.

Matt's a tried and true car guy and his experience tells a story of someone who really cares about his hobby. The fact that he can build a SEMA show quality Ford truck, then turn around to build a JDM Silvia that looks straight out of Tokyo is a special kind of feat.

The Nissan LEAF has won various accolades around the world including World Car of the Year 2011, Car of the Year 2011 in Europe, and Car of the Year Japan in 2011 and 2012. Among safety, control and comfort features, the electric car features ProPILOT – a “hands-on, eyes-on"" system that allows the car to stop, restart and stay centered in its lane and e-Pedal technology for one-pedal driving.

Nissan says that the LEAF EV owners have driven more than 14.8 billion clean-air kilometers since 2010 and have collectively helped prevent more than 2.4 billion kilograms of CO2 emissions.

Ray Abelada was fortunate enough to get his hands on this KH2 Gunmetal model, and his train of thought on modifying it almost derails the notion that wild, in-your-face mods need to accompany Nissan's classically boxy, muscular '90s hero. Unlike many of you, Ray didn't daydream about blasting around town in Nissan's turbocharged, AWD wonder. His attention was locked into another brand entirely. ""I grew up in the late '90s era and I've always been a Honda guy,"" he states. The idea of importing and tackling this build was a result of his friend, Tony, who'd been talking about building a JDM Integra. ""I started looking for my own JDM project car. I wanted something unique and that could stand out on its own.""

JDM Driver

The unplanned search led to the hunt for a Skyline GTS-T model, and with very few options in his region, he came up short. ""Two months had passed, and I missed out on several purchases. I eventually broadened my search to include GT-Rs and accidentally found Driver Motorsports through a Google image search in January 2017."" Reaching out to Chris Driver to get more info on a GT-R they had on their website, Ray was hit with the bad news as Chris informed him the car had already been spoken for. However, it wasn't all bad—the Premium JDM importer was expecting another GT-R shortly and Ray was eager to get a look.

With a number of photos and info provided by Driver Motorsports on their incoming Skyline, Ray was sold and immediately wired a deposit to make sure he didn't miss the opportunity. Not even a week later, Ray, and his family geared up for a 3-hour drive to bring home their new family weekend car. Starting with a clean chassis is always a good idea and this R32 was in excellent shape. So impressed by the newly acquired skyline's condition and his overall experience with the transaction, Ray's extended family visited Driver Motorsports and picked up a Nissan Gloria and Laurel.

Groomed to Perfection

The only modifications done to the R32 upon Ray taking ownership were M's intake pods and a Kakimoto exhaust system. Like almost any enthusiast, regardless of brand or vehicle type, the first set of changes were based on coilovers and a set of wheels. In actuality, those wound up being the only upgrades for an entire year as he just wanted to enjoy the car as-is. Of course, with so many aftermarket options just a few keystrokes away, it's not hard to justify picking up some new parts, and Ray finally gave in, ordering a custom-spec set of Leon Hardiritt Reise wheels through Phil of RavSpec. A lengthy process being that the rollers would still have to be built and make their way back across the pond, it granted more than enough time to get ahold of some additional goods.

Rather than trying to pack on additional body panel muscle, Ray decided to highlight the coupe's natural angles with an N1 style front lip to fill out the front bumper, then capped it off with an Ab Flug carbon-fiber front diffuser. The combination is seamless and updates the Skyline's front without stepping away from its early '90s charm. A vented Seibon carbon hood finishes off the front end's mild makeover.

To streamline the sides of the GT-R, and match the flow of the front bumper's new, lower appearance, a set of Shorin carbon-fiber side skirts were sourced through RHDJapan and lead your eyes toward the Gracer/Trust rear bumper spats that, in conjunction with the factory rear quarter panel lines, help encapsulate the rear. Other additions include sleek GKTEch side mirrors and atop the trunk you'll spot a factory spoiler that's been topped with a Fujimura carbon gurney flap. To tie everything together, the 19x10 +20 Leon Hardiritt wheels arrived and were wrapped in 255/35s and offer a gunmetal face to match the Skyline's body and a polished lip to offset the look.

As much as we like the outside look of this build, the interior might be one of its best attributes. The dash panels confirm that Driver Motorsports imports some immaculate cars, as the surfaces look picture perfect. Enhancing the look and adding Ray's touch included a set of Recaro Wildcats and matching door panel inserts that play nicely with the red laced Momo wheel and restitched shift and e-brake boots.

More Power on the Horizon

By now you've grown accustomed to seeing 700-plus hp Skylines with huge single turbo conversions and so have we, but in Ray's case, he's eased himself into the power production part of the build. The factory turbos were rebuilt using steel blades and a Mine's equal-length downpipe was bolted on in addition to a set of Tomei dump tubes with the brand's titanium test pipe and exhaust. More fuel is provided by FIC 750s and a Walbro pump and in the hands of Driver Motorsports, the Haltech Platinum Pro brings power up to 373hp safely and reliably.

Photo 20/20 | Personalizing An Iconic 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R View Photo Gallery (20) Photos

Those numbers certainly aren't here to stay, and Ray fully expects to outgrow that power output as a pair of GT2860s at home can attest. He notes, ""I didn't want to run them on the stock bottom end and oil pump. I figure the safest way is to pull the motor and upgrade to forged internals, then install the GT2860's and get it retuned.""","<div><p class=""article-text"">Cars like this 1990 R32 <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/"">Nissan</a> Skyline GT-R don't come along very often.

Tire-shredding to the max, Robert Anthony of Arizona's 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R is one of the dopest R32 we've featured in recent years.",10/09/2020,"Intro by Sam Du

I attended a local Southern California car meet a couple of weeks ago when I had a revelation about Nissan's third generation Skyline GT-R: they're everywhere! I legit saw more JDM R32 GT-Rs than Scions or Civics. We can credit this to the recent ruling passed a few years ago that allows any imported car 25 years or older to be exempt from National Traffic Highway Safety Administration regulations (don't forget to read our guide to importing a JDM car). Since then, it's quite common for every container sailing in from Japan to have an assortment of used and semi-abused right-hand-drive R32 Skylines, which in turn has filled the market with a healthy amount of them.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating, and I still get a little giddy every time I see one on the road. Perhaps what I'm trying to say is that since the GT-R was every JDM fanboys dream car and they're now legal and affordable to own ($32,500 can get you something really nice on BringATrailer.com), if you're going to want to standout as an R32 owner these days, then you're going to have to go above and beyond, which is exactly what Orlando Villalobos did with his 1989 Skyline GT-R.

Originally from Corpus Christi, Texas, Orlando is now a master sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Group A '80s and '90s touring cars were always his thing from playing the original Gran Turismo, so he gravitated to the all-wheel-drive GT-R over the likes of the Toyota Supra and Ford Sierra; however, it wasn't until he was much older that he would finally be able to fulfill his childhood fantasy and own one in America.

On the outside, his GT-R looks every bit like it's ready to battle on Tsukuba Circuit (interestingly, Orlando's Voltex rear wing was sourced from a retired racecar that previously put down rocket-fast lap times at Fuji Speedway). There's a laundry list of dope JDM parts that make this car very authentic; however, it's what's underneath that makes it truly special. Modern-day reliability and 500+whp performance help make this 31-year-old project car more impressive than the dated Group A racecars Orlando once envied decades ago.

Photo 23/23 | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive View Photo Gallery (23) Photos

Can this RB26DETT handle more power than what it's putting down now? You bet it can. Orlando explains the engine and fuel system can withstand up to 800whp. For now, he intends to improve his driving skills and learn the car more at local track days before swapping to a larger turbo. ""I love the allure of challenging myself and racing the clock to see if I can best myself. This is a form of personal advancement and I feel we can all use a little personal accountability to become better in life where possible.""

Before I sign off, there is an untold story that Orlando wants people to know. The journey toward obtaining and building his dream car was far from easy. He's reminded every instance he gets behind the wheel to never take life for granted, and that we shouldn't either. I'll let Orlando take the stage...

LIVING A LIFE OF NO REGRETS

""In 2010 I was deployed to Afghanistan. It was a rough deployment that I had never experienced in the previous four years I had been in. I had been blown up and shot at multiple times. After I lost a mentor of mine, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Master Sergeant Daniel Fedder, I realized how fragile and short life was. I told myself I would begin living life with less regrets and that I would do things I always said I would. Owning my dream car, the Skyline GT-R (obsessed about it since the Gran Turismo days), was one of those things.

ULTIMATE FIND CLOSE TO HOME

During days back on the base, I started searching on the internet for one. Ironically, one popped up in the larger city neighboring my hometown, Corpus Christi, Texas. When I called from an iridium satellite phone, the owner and now friend, Josh ""Joshiroku"" Garcia saw the crazy number and hung up on me thinking I was just another tire kicker. Days later, my parents got in touch with him and informed him that I was indeed real and had intentions of owning the car. Josh, who also had family in the military, told my parents he would take them for a test drive and would hold the car for me until I decided I wanted it. Naturally, I did, so my parents handed him a check within that week and the car then belonged to me.

CURSED R32

It was fairly stock appearing but also had a semi-built engine and BCNR33 Brembo brakes. It also had a some very nice gold BBS LM wheels that had been acquired by someone who unfortunately had an untimely death about a week after the wheel transaction. That was when I should've known the car had a curse...

NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE

Three days after I returned from Afghanistan and started driving the car, I lost control driving at a moderately low speed while taking a very easy curve. There was no reason the car should've lost control. HICAS had been blocked out and there was no oil or debris on the road. The car tried to kill me. The car bounced around and I somehow shortly developed rod knock.

THE CURSE STRIKES AGAIN

Not long after, I received orders to move to Okinawa. The car sat while I went overseas to Okinawa, Korea, Philippines, and lived in Dubai for a year before returning back to Okinawa and eventually moving back to California in 2014. While working in Dubai, Josh Garcia, whom I purchased the car from, swapped in a BCNR33 engine and helped with some of the current aero. After getting situated in California, the car was shipped out to me; that's when the curse struck again. The enclosed trailer transport driver got a flat tire and while changing the flat on his truck, somehow the truck fell off the jack stands and crushed him to death.

FOWL PLAY

Weeks later, the car was picked up and delivered by another individual where it seldomly was driven. While preparing for yet another deployment in 2015, I trusted the car with an 'RB specialist' that I was introduced to. He was to change belts and fluids and prepare the car for a seven-month storage, but instead, he drove the car 'like he stole it' and returned it back to me with rod knock. I couldn't do much, so I stored the car and eventually nearly lost all motivation in getting it running again. It bounced from one failed shop to another and everything else in between.

BARDABE SAVES THE DAY

In 2018, I met Juan Vargas, owner of Bardabe Performance (now located in Austin, Texas) and things finally started to look up. Juan helped me with planning to achieve my goals of a safe, responsive, and overengineered car. I wanted to stabilize the car so its tail wouldn't fly out from behind it. I wanted a responsive and strong car so it wouldn't have the unfortunate rod knock again.

In December of 2019, after waiting months for an N1 block, its single turbo conversion, all the amazing hard lines, custom fuel system, wiring harness and Leask-Spec advanced cooling system, the car was ready to break its curse. Juan was dead set on eliminating any future failures, like oil lines that usually fail on the super-hot running RBs. He was persistent to see me actually fully enjoy the car since he had seen how long it had been off the road due to other's lack of care previously.

POSITIVE FUTURE

The plan is now to retain a street tamed car that can conquer any obstacle thrown at it and with zero failures. Future goals are to upgrade to a BNR34 six-speed GETRAG transmission and updated, stronger arms and sway bars. Eventually the car will be ready for track events, but for the time being it'll remain a daily reminder of how life is too short to not enjoy, and how all 'curses' and bad luck can be overcome with the right people pushing you in the right direction."" - Orlando Villalobos

AMERICAN MADE R32 SKYLINE GT-RS

Extremely clean 1991 Nissan Skyline GT-R, a SoCal street build by Ed Liu with the help of GReddy.

Originally photographed in Japan, this 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R built by Peter Cervantes now lives in Washington.

Tire-shredding to the max, Robert Anthony of Arizona's 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R is one of the dopest R32 we've featured in recent years.","<div><p class=""article-text"">Intro by Sam Du</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">I attended a local Southern California car meet a couple of weeks ago when I had a revelation about <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/"">Nissan</a>'s third generation Skyline GT-R: they're everywhere! I legit saw more JDM R32 GT-Rs than Scions or Civics. We can credit this to the recent ruling passed a few years ago that allows any imported car 25 years or older to be exempt from National Traffic Highway Safety Administration regulations (don't forget to read our <a href=""http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1704-how-to-import-a-jdm-car-importing-the-dream"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">guide to importing a JDM car</a>). Since then, it's quite common for every container sailing in from Japan to have an assortment of used and semi-abused right-hand-drive R32 Skylines, which in turn has filled the market with a healthy amount of them.</p><br /><br /><p class=""dart_ad"" id=""gpt-ad-slot-inner-1968052298-orlando-villalobos-1989-nissan-skyline-gtr-r32-turbo""><br /> <br /></p><br />            <p class=""dart_ad"" id=""gpt-ad-slot-inner-1828660427-orlando-villalobos-1989-nissan-skyline-gtr-r32-turbo""><br /> <br /></p><br />            <p class=""dart_ad"" id=""gpt-ad-slot-inner-521233727-orlando-villalobos-1989-nissan-skyline-gtr-r32-turbo""><br /> <br /></p><br />            <p></p><br /><p class=""dart_ad"" id=""gpt-ad-slot-tout-1x1-incontent-orlando-villalobos-1989-nissan-skyline-gtr-r32-turbo""><br /> <br /></p><br />    <a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-NISMO-Front-Bumper.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R NISMO Front Bumper"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R NISMO Front Bumper""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-NISMO-Front-Bumper.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R NISMO Front Bumper""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 23/23</span></a> | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (23) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text"">Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating, and I still get a little giddy every time I see one on the road.

Group A '80s and '90s touring cars were always his thing from playing the original Gran Turismo, so he gravitated to the all-wheel-drive GT-R over the likes of the <a href=""http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/news/toms-jgtc-mk4-supra-to-be-restored/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Toyota Supra</a> and <a href=""https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/"">Ford</a> Sierra; however, it wasn't until he was much older that he would finally be able to fulfill his childhood fantasy and own one in America.</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">On the outside, his GT-R looks every bit like it's ready to battle on Tsukuba Circuit (interestingly, Orlando's Voltex rear wing was sourced from a retired racecar that previously put down rocket-fast lap times at Fuji Speedway). There's a laundry list of dope JDM parts that make this car very authentic; however, it's what's underneath that makes it truly special. Modern-day reliability and 500+whp performance help make this 31-year-old project car more impressive than the dated Group A racecars Orlando once envied decades ago.</p><br /><br /><p id=""ac-lre-player""></p><br /><a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-RB26DETT-Engine.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R RB26DETT Engine"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R RB26DETT Engine""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-RB26DETT-Engine.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R RB26DETT Engine""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 23/23</span></a> | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (23) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text"">Can this <a href=""http://www.superstreetonline.com/how-to/engine/1808-rb26dett-or-2jz-gte-which-six-is-sexier/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">RB26DETT</a> handle more power than what it's putting down now? You bet it can. Orlando explains the engine and fuel system can withstand up to 800whp. For now, he intends to improve his driving skills and learn the car more at local track days before swapping to a larger turbo. ""I love the allure of challenging myself and racing the clock to see if I can best myself. This is a form of personal advancement and I feel we can all use a little personal accountability to become better in life where possible.""</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">Before I sign off, there is an untold story that Orlando wants people to know. The journey toward obtaining and building his dream car was far from easy. He's reminded every instance he gets behind the wheel to never take life for granted, and that we shouldn't either. I'll let Orlando take the stage...</p><br /><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>LIVING A LIFE OF NO REGRETS</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">""In 2010 I was deployed to Afghanistan. It was a rough deployment that I had never experienced in the previous four years I had been in. I had been blown up and shot at multiple times. After I lost a mentor of mine, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Master Sergeant Daniel Fedder, I realized how fragile and short life was. I told myself I would begin living life with less regrets and that I would do things I always said I would. Owning my dream car, the Skyline GT-R (obsessed about it since the Gran Turismo days), was one of those things.</p><br /><br /><a class=""img-link"" href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Rize-Japan-Canards.jpg?width=&amp;height="" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Rize Japan Canards"" target=""_blank""><br />            <img class=""secondary-image-large secondary-image"" alt=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Rize Japan Canards""><br />        </a><br />        <span class=""img-caption""><a></a><span><a href=""http://assets.superstreetonline.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/1989-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-Rize-Japan-Canards.jpg?width=&amp;height="" target=""_blank"" title=""1989 Nissan Skyline GT R Rize Japan Canards""><span class=""photo-count"">Photo 23/23</span></a> | 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R: Keeping That Group A Spirit Alive</span></span><p class=""bottom-gallery-link""><br />        <p class=""view-gallery"">View Photo Gallery (23) Photos</p><br />    </p><br /><p class=""article-text""></p><h3>ULTIMATE FIND CLOSE TO HOME</h3><br /><br /><p class=""article-text"">During days back on the base, I started searching on the internet for one.

Days later, my parents got in touch with him and informed him that I was indeed real and had intentions of owning the car. Josh, who also had family in the military, told my parents he would take them for a test drive and would hold the car for me until I decided I wanted it.

Continua a mietere successi e record, la Nissan Leaf. L’auto full electric del produttore giapponese, capace di aggiudicarsi diversi premi e riconoscimenti in tutto il mondo (come lo “European Car of the Year” e il “World Car of the Year” nel 2011 e il “Car of the Year Japan” nel 2011-2012) taglia un traguardo storico per il mondo della mobilità alternativa.

La Leaf ha infatti raggiunto e superato il traguardo dei 500 mila modelli prodotti e consegnati a clienti in tutto il mondo, dimostrando così che il progetto nato e sviluppato 10 anni fa nel Paese del Sol Levante era destinato al successo. La vettura numero mezzo milione è stata assemblata nel sito produttivo di Sunderland, nel cuore del Regno Unito, dove la casa costruttrice giapponese ha realizzato circa 175 mila modelli della Nissan Leaf. Di questi, 5.700 circolano quotidianamente in Italia. Nel nostro Paese, poi, è possibile acquistare anche la versione Nissan Leaf e+, che garantisce una maggiore autonomia grazie alla batteria potenziata.

A ricevere il veicolo è stata un’ignara coppia di coniugi norvegesi. “Mio marito ed io abbiamo scelto di acquistare Nissan LEAF nel 2018 – ha commentato Maria Jansen, proprietari della Leaf numero 500 mila – ed è stato amore a prima vista. Siamo molto fieri di avere la 500 millesima Leaf prodotta perché grazie alla maggiore autonomia e alle tecnologie avanzate, soddisfa pienamente le nostre esigenze”.

Nonostante i due coniugi abbiano deciso di acquistare la loro auto elettrica nel 2018, la consegna è avvenuta solo qualche tempo dopo. In una data, però, tutt’altro che casuale: la Nissan Leaf numero 500 mila è arrivata a casa della coppia norvegese lo scorso 9 settembre, data nella quale si celebra il World EV Day, ossia la giornata mondiale dedicata ai veicoli a trazione completamente elettrica (l’acronimo “EV”, per i pochi che non lo sapessero, sta proprio per “Electric Vehicle”).

Diverse le tecnologie che, in questi 10 anni, hanno contribuito al successo dell’auto elettrica giapponese. Il sistema e-Pedal, ad esempio, permette di guidare con il solo pedale dell’acceleratore e migliorare in maniera sensibile le prestazioni del sistema di recupero dell’energia in frenata. Il ProPILOT, invece, unisce diversi sistemi di assistenza alla guida che assistono il conducente in fase di sterzata, accelerazione e frenata.

Infine, il produttore del Paese del Sol Levante sta implementando anche in Italia la rete proprietaria di colonnine Fast Charge, che consentono di ricaricare in fretta la batteria della Leaf. Facendo il “pieno” in una delle stazioni di ricarica Nissan, è possibile ricaricare la batteria dal 20% al 60% in appena un’ora.","<div><p class=""hatom-extra""><br />editato in:  <br />da  <br /></p><p>Continua a mietere successi e record, la <strong>Nissan Leaf</strong>.

Nissan offers the Leaf with two battery packs, the base 40 kWh and the 62 kWh E+ model. The base Leaf with the 40 kWh pack offers a driving range of up to 168 miles (270 km) while the Leaf E+ achieves 239 miles (385 km) in the WLTP cycle.

The bigger battery variant of the Nissan Leaf also features a more powerful 214 HP electric motor, over the base model’s 148 HP, and it’s compatible with fast-charging. The 62 kWh battery pack is also 25 percent more energy-dense than the standard pack but it also makes the car heavier by 331 lbs (150 kg).

The Nissan Leaf features the company’s ProPilot semi-autonomous driving system, as well as e-Pedal technology that allows one-pedal driving.

Nissan’s next chapter in the EV world will be the 2022 Ariya, a fully electric SUV that will be offered in four different variants and the choice between a 65 kWh and a 90 kWh battery pack.

It shows the car's silhouette and badge, along with the headlights and taillights that are inspired by historic Z models.

A prototype version of the new Nissan Z will debut September 15.

The new Nissan Z's design will take inspiration from its predecessors, if this new teaser video is any indication. It draws a clear line between the original 240Z and the new model's headlight shape, while also showing the taillights that are clearly a nod to the legendary 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Nissan

We can also see the silhouette of the Z, which Nissan has teased before, and the car's new badge that's on the rear flank of the car. It appears to have a similar shape as the current model, but the details should make it look far more modern than the 370Z, which arrived way back in 2009.



We expect the new Z to be called 400Z and be powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine. It'll retain the classic front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and will hopefully come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. (If it doesn't, we'll be disappointed.) The so-called ""Z Proto"" that debuts September 15 will likely be similar to the eventual production model that should arrive later this year before going on sale sometime in 2021.

The rear end is heavily disguised, but it appears pretty evolutionary. However, the model appears to adopt slimmer taillights and a wider third brake light.

Bigger changes occur inside as the cabin is far more modern and high-tech than its predecessor. While the steering wheels looks pretty familiar, there’s a new digital instrument and a free-standing infotainment system. We can also see new climate controls and what appears to be a push-button shifter.

Specifications remain a mystery, but the crossover is slated to ride on the CMF-C/D platform and be offered with an assortment of turbocharged petrol engines. The diesel engines will reportedly be dropped, but there could be eco-friendly alternatives in the form of plug-in hybrid and range-extended EV options.

Nissan hasn’t said much about the Qashqai, but recent reports have suggested the crossover has been delayed until mid-2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. That remains unconfirmed, but the company said they’ll have more to share in the coming months.

Of course, we can also expect the crossover to arrive stateside as the next-generation Rogue Sport.

The milestone Leaf was produced at the automaker's Sunderland, England, factory in August, but Nissan held off on announcing it until Wednesday to coincide with World EV Day.

The car will go to an owner in Norway—Maria Jansen.

""My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it,"" Jansen said in a statement. ""We're very excited to become the proud owners of the 500,000th Nissan Leaf. This car really meets our needs with extended range and enhanced technologies.""

Nissan launched the first-generation Leaf in December 2010, making it the first mass-market all-electric car to go on sale. The current, second-generation, Leaf was introduced for the 2018 model year.

While 500,000 electric cars is a noteworthy achievement, it's taken Nissan much longer to reach that goal than originally expected. And it's not the first EV to get there; the Tesla Model 3 passed that mark earlier this year.

the 500,000th Nissan Leaf and owner Maria Jansen

Nissan originally targeted the production of 500,000 EVs by 2012, including the Leaf and other cars using its companion AESC battery technology. Including sales in China, it would have been even more.

Other electric models have been slow to materialize. Nissan sells the e-NV200 electric van in certain markets, and plans to launch the Ariya crossover as a 2022 model. An EV for Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand is expected as well.

It's been less than a year and a half since the Leaf crossed 400,000 sales, though, and that's a testament to the model's extensive refresh for 2018. Sales have picked up in some of the Leaf's global markets—like Europe, where it was the top-selling EV for the 2018 calendar year.

But in the United States and elsewhere, the Tesla Model 3 has taken the lead in EV sales most months.

Meanwhile, Nissan's production in Smyrna has made Tennessee one of the hotbeds for EV production in the U.S. Volkswagen is now planning to bring ID.4 production to its Chattanooga factory in 2022.

Let's not forget the name—Leaf has a powerful meaning referring to how in choosing an EV we're choosing cleaner air.

Ghosn's arrest in the Japanese capital in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct made headlines worldwide and kicked off an astonishing fall from grace for the businessman, once hailed as a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.

But Kelly was also detained that day, having been effectively lured back to Japan from the United States on the premise of an urgent meeting.

And with Ghosn in Lebanon as an international fugitive after he made an audacious escape while out on bail in Tokyo last year, Kelly is now the only person expected to face trial any time soon in connection with the case.

Read: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn gone, American Kelly faces Japan trial alone

The American lawyer appears in court from Tuesday facing a single charge: of conspiring to under-report tens of million of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly promised after his retirement.

Kelly, who will turn 64 on the day the trial opens, denies any wrongdoing. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.

The trial, expected to last around 10 months, centres around one question, fraught with complex technicalities: did Kelly and Nissan between 2010 and 2018 illegally conceal payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($87 million at today's rates) promised to Ghosn on retirement?

Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.

But Kelly has insisted on his innocence since day one.

""I didn't do anything wrong,"" he told AFP in an interview in early September.

""Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything,"" he insisted.

Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that these future payments were pledged to Ghosn, and therefore should have been disclosed in the firm's financial filings as required by Japanese law.

Prosecutors have amassed a vast amount of documents, only a small portion of which the defence have been given so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.

Despite that, his team decided to agree to move to trial, arguing they had ""no choice"", with Kelly prevented from leaving the country and separated from his family while he waits for his case to go to court.

Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted, despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 percent of the criminal cases they bring to court.

But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.

The defence say some witnesses who could help acquit Kelly fear being detained if they testify in person in Japan.

""There is no trust in the Japanese judiciary system among foreign witnesses,"" Kelly's US lawyer James Wareham told AFP.

""They are afraid, they are not going to come to Japan.""

Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer Yoichi Kitamura said he is ""confident we can win the case"".

Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a spokeswoman saying only ""we do not comment on pending litigation"".

The company appears uncomfortable to finally have arrived at the court date, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.

One of the trial's key witnesses will be Hari Nada, Kelly's former colleague, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.

Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.

Up until recently, rumours of an upcoming coupe to replace the 370Z could've been laughed at, considering how Nissan is fairing in the big scheme of things following Carlos Ghosn's fall from grace.

But alas, the same company that brought us some of the most insane performance cars from the nineties has pulled through on its promise to deliver yet another Z car, and this thing is shaping up to be awesome.

Dubbed the 'Proto Z', we already know that it's going to take styling inspiration from the older Fairladies such as the 240Z and the 300ZX, but feature modern tech that makes it competitive with Toyota's revived Supra.

Just last night, Nissan dropped a teaser for the Proto Z that not only revealed what the car's engine will sound like, but confirmed that the 400Z will be available with a manual transmission. Oh, and a manual handbrake if you're interested.

This is a massive move for the enthusiasts on Nissan's part, and is also somewhat of a dig at Toyota, as a manual transmission isn't currently offered on the BMW-built Supra.

A few more details are revealed in the short clip, such as the 'Z' emblems on the door sills, wide alloy wheels, and a pair of LED headlights.

When it comes to the engine, it's no surprise to hear that familiar V6 tone, except this one will come with a pair of turbochargers. Reports state that Nissan is using a 3.0-litre Infiniti engine that is shared with the Q50 and Q60 Red Sport.

Today, Nissan has confirmed in a YouTube video that it will feature a manual transmission.

The video pans sideways to a manual gear lever, then the driver slots it into first gear. So there you have it! The next-gen Z will definitely come with a manual transmission, which, in case you were missing the theme here, is a great thing. It also has a manual emergency brake, a feature slowly (and sadly) being replaced by electric parking brakes in other models.

Nissan threw us a few more bones in this latest teaser. For one, we can hear the engine as it revs away in the video. It sounds like a V6, and our ears are also picking up on it being turbocharged. The intel we gained at the beginning of this year suggests both those assumptions are true, as sources revealed to us that the next-gen Z would feature a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6. Those same sources also suggested it’d be offered with a manual transmission and feature retro styling, both of which appear to be on the table.

Some design elements are teased, too. We get to see where Nissan has stuck a few Z badges. Locations include the sill plates, behind the gear lever and on the brake calipers. The intriguing lights have already been shown, but we’re still digging the retro vibes they suggest.

To see the full reveal, tune in on September 15 at 8:30 p.m. ET. And watch out in the meantime, because we wouldn’t be surprised if Nissan has another teaser or two left to drop on us before next week.

Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic.
The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.
The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.
The JFC's loan guarantees, which will be covered by taxpayer funds if the loans go sour, are the last line of defense in terms of corporate support.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- The Japanese government's de facto guarantee of a record 130 billion yen ($1.22 billion) in emergency loans to Nissan Motor underscores a lack of transparency over coronavirus-related rescue programs for businesses.

The Development Bank of Japan extended over 1.88 trillion yen in crisis response loans between March and July as the virus damaged the national and global economy. Nissan is the only major corporation covered by guarantees from the state-backed Japan Finance Corp.

But other large companies could receive bailouts similar to Nissan's if the coronavirus crisis persists. Private-sector lenders have diminishing capacity to respond to financing demands due to the rash of loan approvals during the pandemic. Japan's three megabanks granted 1.2 trillion yen in financing to Toyota Motor alone.

""We've accepted almost all loan requests from the first wave of applications, but second helpings [of additional financing] will be tough,"" said an executive at a megabank. Considering demand is not expected to recover amid the pandemic, the extra financing risks becoming toxic debt.

Banks already were limited in how much they can loan to each company or group based on the need to keep their financial institution sound. The Financial Stability Board, an international body made up of financial watchdogs, reportedly has shifted from encouraging loans that keep companies afloat to debating how to maintain the health of banking institutions.

If private lenders approach their limits, then public-sector institutions like the Development Bank of Japan will start filling the gap.

The DBJ approves a crisis response loan if it deems the company to have a sufficiently large impact on livelihoods and Japan's economy. Job creation and a wide base of subcontractors are two factors in the approval process. Normally, the DBJ assumes the risk if the debt cannot be recovered.

The bank decided to lend Nissan a total of 180 billion yen in May. Japan was under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Automobile production was at a virtual standstill, and vehicle purchases had plummeted.

Nissan employs 140,000 people groupwide, and the blow would be even larger if subcontractors are counted. The DBJ also apparently considered that private-sector banks' efforts to provide assistance would be harmed if Nissan did not receive financial support.

The loan to Nissan is funded through the Japan Finance Corp. The government is providing guarantees on 130 billion yen of the loan, with the JFC to shoulder 80% if Nissan cannot repay the money.

A JFC loan guarantee is not unusual under the crisis response system. Individual recipients of the guarantees are not expected to be disclosed since that could affect the company's credit rating. The Finance Ministry website lists only one unspecified loan guarantee valued at 130 billion yen.

A Nissan spokesman says the automaker is ""completely unaware"" of the government guarantee.

In addition to the program's lack of transparency, there is the issue of ensuring managerial discipline of companies receiving such guarantees. In 2010, Japan Airlines received 350 billion yen in public funds, along with government-guaranteed financing. At the time, the distressed carrier faced withering scrutiny over its business practices. Nissan's situation has not deteriorated to that extent.

The silver car was sold to an owner in Hawaii.
It's also worth noting that this car is not the R34 GT-R Walker drove in ""2 Fast 2 Furious.""",15/09/2020,"The late Paul Walker was a big fan of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, owning several of them, including this R34 model. This video offers a deep dive into the car's history from someone who knows it inside and out. Craig Lieberman was a technical advisor for the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, and helped introduce Walker to the GT-R.

An R32 GT-R at a ""Fast and Furious"" car casting call piqued Walker's interest, Lieberman said, so he took the actor to MotoRex, a company that was importing and federalizing GT-Rs at the time (this was before the model was officially launched in the United States with the R35 generation). MotoRex then loaned Walker an R34—nicknamed ""Blackbird""—for an extended test drive.

After the test drive, Walker purchased the car featured in this video. It's a 1999 V-Spec model painted in Sonic Silver. V-Spec models got a few performance upgrades over the base GT-R, including an active limited-slip differential and stiffer suspension. However, it was soon surpassed by the V-Spec II, and later by the even more hardcore M-Spec and Nismo Z-Tune models.

Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec

Walker later traded the silver V-Spec for a white V-Spec II, according to Lieberman. The silver car was sold to an owner in Hawaii. Intending to make the car into a replica of the MotoRex Blackbird (while retaining the silver color), he installed a C-West bodykit, as well as a carbon-fiber hood and some other performance parts.

The car was later seized from its Hawaiian owner by the DEA as part of an asset-forfeiture ruling, and sold at auction. It went to an owner in Texas, who kept it for about 15 years, Lieberman said. It was sold earlier this year to JDM importer Toprank. The R34 is one of only 14 federalized Skyline GT-Rs imported by MotoRex (other R34 Skylines won't be legal to import until 2024 under the 25-year-rule), according to Lieberman. That, along with the connection to Paul Walker, means this car is likely worth about $400,000, he said.

It's also worth noting that this car is not the R34 GT-R Walker drove in ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" They aren't even the same shade of silver (the movie car was painted in a non-factory hue from U.S. firm House of Kolor). That was actually Lieberman's own personal car. It's currently in the hands of an anonymous owner, and reportedly no longer appears as it did in the movie.","<div><p>The late Paul Walker was a big fan of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, owning several of them, including this R34 model.

However, it was soon surpassed by the V-Spec II, and later by the even more hardcore M-Spec and Nismo Z-Tune models.</p><br /><p></p><p class=""ac-floating-trigger""></p><img name=""tccimg_100759472_l"" title=""Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec"" src=""data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs="" alt=""Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec"" width=""1024"" height=""553"" class=""lazy""><p>Paul Walker's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-Spec</p><p>Walker later traded the silver V-Spec for a white V-Spec II, according to Lieberman. The silver car was sold to an owner in Hawaii. Intending to make the car into a replica of the MotoRex Blackbird (while retaining the silver color), he installed a C-West bodykit, as well as a carbon-fiber hood and some other performance parts.</p><br /><p>The car was later seized from its Hawaiian owner by the DEA as part of an asset-forfeiture ruling, and sold at auction. It went to an owner in Texas, who kept it for about 15 years, Lieberman said. It was sold earlier this year to JDM importer Toprank. The R34 is one of only 14 federalized Skyline GT-Rs imported by MotoRex (other R34 Skylines won't be legal to import until 2024 under the 25-year-rule), according to Lieberman. That, along with the connection to Paul Walker, means this car is likely worth about $400,000, he said.</p><br /><p>It's also worth noting that this car is not the R34 GT-R Walker drove in ""<a href=""https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1126235_deep-dive-brian-s-r34-nissan-skyline-gt-r-from-2-fast-2-furious"">2 Fast 2 Furious</a>."" They aren't even the same shade of silver (the movie car was painted in a non-factory hue from U.S. firm House of Kolor). That was actually Lieberman's own personal car. It's currently in the hands of an anonymous owner, and reportedly no longer appears as it did in the movie.</p><br /></div>",0.047,0.027000000000000003,0.652,ZST9i7iCNUTXBpdsyQgQ2Q,,

He goes through a lot to support electric car adoption. The video above shows the process Cameli adopts to be able to charge his Nissan Leaf. His other heroic act in helping get more people into EVs is a world map he has created to help other Leaf owners to replace the batteries in their cars. And you can help him make it even better.

Cameli came up with the idea of creating NissanLeafBatteryReplacement.com to help Leaf owner back in February 2018, as he told InsideEVs:

“Back then, I heard of a company named MUXSAN. They were swapping out LEAF battery packs and I figured it would be good to have a Facebook group to discuss this with other LEAF owners. So I created the ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Upgrades / 3rd Party / Aftermarket / EV’ Group on Facebook. On that group, I started a pinned post with a listing of aftermarket LEAF Battery Mechanics on January 28, 2020, and the list grew to 18 installers & suppliers until August of this year.”

That was when people that were not on Facebook started to ask Cameli for help.

“That's why I figured it was time to create a website. The number one term that people searched for was ‘Nissan LEAF Battery Replacement’ and that's why I chose that name. I also own ‘Nissan LEAF battery Installers.’”

Cameli bought the domain on August 17, 2020, and the site went live on August 26, 2020. The idea to make it a global repository came precisely from MUXSAN, which is in the Netherlands.

Ever since InsideEVs wrote about the EV Rides service of replacing Leaf battery packs, we have been receiving requests from other companies all over the world that also perform this sort of service. Cameli came to their rescue, as you can see below.

Speaking about his experience with the car in the video above, Cameli bought his brand new Nissan Leaf SL on April 20, 2013.

“It has 82,000 miles and I have lost 6 bars. I can drive 35 miles now at 40 mph, and around 30 at 60 mph. A couple of months ago, I had to drive to a client who was 157 miles round trip. The total drive took me 11.5 hours because I had to charge five times.”

This is the sort of sacrifice we hope he does not have to do for much longer when he gets a new battery pack for his Nissan. For what he told us, his car is in much need of that.

It is vital to notice Cameli is just listing the companies that perform these services. Their prices and even the quality of their services is beyond his control. That said, make sure these companies have good reputations and ask them about their fees before closing any deal. The more companies available, the better.

You can help Cameli and other used EV cars find these companies close to their homes by informing the map creator of the ones that perform the same services EV Rides and MUXSAN do. Whether you own the place or is just aware of any such businesses, get in touch with him through sal@electricsal.com and tell him about any battery pack replacement company you are aware of.

When Cameli started his website, he had 18 locations. His map now has 29 battery pack replacement businesses, and we suspect this article will help that increase a lot more. That shows the potential aftermarket companies dedicated to keeping electric cars running may become a fantastic business opportunity. We’re glad that we are finally discussing these aftermarket battery packs, but we should discuss them even more. Help save used EVs!

Pros and Cons Pros SR20 is a dream, Manual makes this car heaps of fun Cons Beware of anyonr with a screwdriver, Over 500 stolen in 2019

- shares





After having my Pulsar Plus stolen while I was at work one day, there was a N15 shaped hole in my heart. But after a few months a British Racing Green (as I like to call it) SSS showed up on Facebook marketplace. Not knowing how to drive manual yet, I had the seller drive me around the hills. I was happy with what I saw and $1200 bucks later I had a car that my friend drove home for me. The SR20 engine squeezed into that engine bay was an awesome thing. It had decent low-down torque, yet it could rev out to the stars. From memory it was up over 8000rpm. The aftermarket muffler had it sounding pretty neat for a 4-cylinder. A fuel economy of around 8 litres per 100 kilometres was the usual for my suburban mix.

Driving in traffic was a little annoying as first gear was locked out until you were at walking pace, but torque in 2nd gear would get you through. Travelling at 100km/h had the engine at 3000rpm, which was a bit loud for listening to podcasts, but not enough to put you off road trips. This meant you could shift 1-2-5 onto the freeway, using all of 2nd gear to get up to speed. Shifting through the five speeds added to the joy, with a longish throw that added to the fun of rowing into each notchy gear. Having driven a 2nd-Gen Mazda 3 shortly after, I much preferred shifting with my arm than just my wrist.

Me and the boys had some fun trying to find a clutch fluid reservoir on this cable clutch system. The pedal wasn't heavy, but wasn't overly communicative either. I had bought this car with what looked like King Low springs already installed. The ""metro bus seat material"" trimmed sports seats held you in well, as it cornered very flat through the hills. The Pulsar did have the tendency to oversteer at the limit, and felt disinterested in any forms of lift-off fun. The steering wheel was on the smaller side, making the rack feel faster, which felt great.

Cupholders were nowhere to be seen, much like in most cars of this era. The rear seats could fold almost flat when pushed down, or could become level when folding forward the rear seat base into the rear seat footwell - perfect for drive-in cinemas. The mirrors were tiny, but visibility was still excellent when looking over your shoulders. That, coupled with an awesome turning circle, made parallel parking a joy instead of a chore. Speakers in the front doors and rear parcel shelf meant you could pump some decent sound with some cheap speakers and a deck. If you are looking to dip your toes into some club racing, this was another area where this car shines. Once I bought this car, I had raced a few hillclimb events, as it was a car I didn't mind if I crashed. I could always replace it. It did a pretty good job in the ""2000cc and under category"", and was a blast to drive at eleven-tenths.

Unfortunately, immobilizers weren't standard fit on the N15 Pulsars, meaning that if you're only using a club lock at work and the shops (and not just at home), you may end up in a situation like I was, with bags packed and ready for a weekend in Marysville but with no car to put them in. My SSS was never seen again after December 27th, 2019. It was my second N15 stolen. Only an insane person would get a third one. It doesn't stop my friends sending me listings and it hasn't stopped me from toying with the idea. MORE: Nissan Pulsar news and reviews

Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.

Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.

In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""

The spokesman said other models would continue to meet the needs of local consumers.

Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.

The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.

Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.

The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.

Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.

The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres. The X-Trail is a sport utility vehicle with a minimal 2.0-litre engine. The Sylphy is a compact car with a 1.6-litre engine.

Upon learning of the reported discontinuation, a Nissan Teana owner who asked not to be named said his family has three Nissan cars, two of which are Teanas. They have proved to be comfortable vehicles, but the family has become worried about resale prices.

Pisit Rangsaritwutikul, president of the Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) under the Industry Ministry, said a change in production lines among car makers during the economic recession caused by the pandemic's impact is normal. They need to adjust themselves to markets in each country.

""I'm not shocked by the news reports,"" Mr Pisit said. ""The parent company will have already carefully considered what car models will be produced to satisfy motorists in different countries.""

Mr Pisit said the Thai market has potential for electric vehicles and companies probably see an opportunity for new business directions.

Nissan's decision reflects its plan to adjust car manufacturing in Thailand by moving towards new-generation cars, following a talk with officials at the Industry Ministry.

Nissan is ""confident"" in Thailand, where it plans to continue its business, Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said in an earlier interview after a recent talk with Ramesh Narasimhan, the president of Nissan Motor Thailand.

Nissan is determined to produce both electric and hybrid cars in the long term and has already won support from the Board of Investment through its incentive programmes, Mr Suriya said.

The company's Yokohama-based headquarters announced in May that Nissan's Indonesian plant would be closed as part of a four-year plan to improve business performance.

The closure would make Thailand Nissan's sole production base in Southeast Asia.","<div><p class=""article-headline""><br /><h2><br />Nissan mum on discontinuation report</h2><br /></p><br /><img src=""https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2020/09/09/3743419.jpg"" alt=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)"" title=""Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)""><br /><br /><br />Nissan gave assurances that Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail would continue to have parts and services provided.&#8201;(Photo by Patipat Janthong)<br /><br /><p>Nissan is choosing not to comment further on a report that it has ended production of Sylphy, Teana and X-Trail models in Thailand but says it's confident in marketing new vehicles, including electric models.</p><p>Nissan Motor Thailand's management said on Tuesday it would neither confirm nor deny the decision.</p>&#13;<br /><p>In a reply to the Bangkok Post's queries, a spokesman said: ""We don't comment on our product strategy.""</p>&#13;<br /><p>The spokesman said other models would&#160;continue to meet the needs of local consumers.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Nissan Motor Thailand reportedly wrote to dealers nationwide on Aug 31 announcing that production and distribution of the three models was ending on Sept 1 under a new marketing and sales plan for Thailand, a reliable source confirmed.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company was placing emphasis on subcompact cars, small multi-purpose vehicles, commercial vehicles and vehicles using alternative energy and electricity, the letter said.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Dealers were advised to stop publicity campaigns and destroy sales promotion material after selling out of the three models.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The company gave assurances that it would supply parts for the three models and continue to service them, to allay concerns among car owners.</p>&#13;<br /><p>Copies of the letter were published on several news websites.</p>&#13;<br /><p>The Teana is a mid-sized sedan with minimal engine capacity of 2.0 litres.

While Nissan has held off on sharing many other details, we speculate that the Z Proto will be powered by the engine found in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60 Red Sport, a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6.

As we revealed earlier this month, Mazda switched sourcing the CX-30 from Thailand to Japan beginning from July production in a move designed to shield the small SUV range from fluctuating currency issues.
For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.
Mazda’s decision to include a manual gearbox model in the CX-30 makes it a rarity among small SUVs, since – out of over 20 models – only a handful follow suit.
These include the Mitsubishi ASX ES (from $23,990), Nissan Qashqai ST (from $28,290), Suzuki Vitara (from $22,990), Skoda Kamiq 85TSI (from $26,990) and Fiat 500X Pop (from $24,990).",15/09/2020,"The strong-selling Mazda CX-30 for 2021 kicks off from a lower price point than before, thanks to an expanded model line-up that now includes a manual transmission option for the first time.

With stock arriving in dealers this month, the CX-30 is now expected to start from $28,990 before on-road costs, meaning that the base Pure grade with a six-speed manual gearbox would represent a $1000 saving over the six-speed automatic alternative with the same G20 2.0-litre four-cylinder front-wheel-drive configuration.

The manual gearbox will not be available on any other grade above Pure, leaving the rest of the range (G20 FWD in Evolve, Touring and Astina, G25 FWD in Touring and Astina, all-wheel-drive G25 Touring, Astina, and X20 Astina 2.0-litre supercharged compression-ignition engined models) as auto-only propositions.

For the same reasons, the older and smaller CX-3 had also changed its manufacturing base for Australia to Japan from Thailand late last year.

Along with a lower starting price, the G20 Pure manual brings slightly different fuel consumption figures; while its published 6.5 litres per 100km on the combined cycle is the same as the G20 auto equivalent, it uses 0.2L/100km less petrol on the extra urban cycle but 0.3L/100km more in the city cycle. Kerb weight also falls by 24kg to 1418kg.

While the 2020 Nissan Qashqai has seemingly been outdone by newer competitors, the automaker has done quite a lot to ensure it isn’t left behind.

Power: 7/10

A few crossovers in this class offer impressive power figures, and unfortunately the Qashqai isn’t among them. Under the hood is a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with peak output rated at 141 hp at and 147 lb-ft of torque. This motor is paired to a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which works well in most conditions. The engine doesn’t feel particularly gutsy, as it just buzzes along. Unfortunately, the CVT can’t work any miracles either, and it pegs the revs at max tilt trying its best to eke out as much momentum as possible, but the Qashqai doesn’t speed up in any particular hurry.

There are a few drive modes to help customize the experience on the road, but only one truly stands out: an all-wheel-drive (AWD) lock function. In normal operation, the AWD system in the Qashqai varies the power split between the front and rear wheels, and generally it prefers the ones in the front to improve fuel consumption. However, the AWD lock mode in the Qashqai sets up a locked split ratio, ensuring all four wheels are getting power. This is mainly used at low speeds in rough terrain and will be a handy feature when the snow begins to pile up.

Fuel Economy: 8/10

AWD models of the Nissan Qashqai are rated at 9.0 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 8.4 in combined driving. This makes the Nissan slightly less efficient than rivals like the Subaru Crosstrek, and slightly more efficient than the Hyundai Kona. It’s not, however, the worst in the segment, with the Jeep Compass rated 1.0 L/100 km more combined.

Driving Feel: 6/10

Firing up the Qashqai and setting off, you don’t get the same eagerness or enthusiasm found in other vehicles in the Nissan range like the smaller Kicks. But the Qashqai doesn’t plod about either. It offers a simple driving experience – one that doesn’t feel engaging, nor is it carefree. Throttle response isn’t extremely energetic, and the light steering feel doesn’t inspire much confidence. While the suspension and ride aren’t too vague, if you push for speed on an on-ramp, you’ll be greeted with a lot of body roll. In these ways the Qashqai pales in comparison to the more responsive and engaging driving dynamics of the Crosstrek and Kona. The Qashqai excels when gently cruising on the highway, as the superb driver assistance features can do the heavy lifting.

Styling: 6/10

Nissan has a mixed design language. Some of the brand’s smaller or more affordable models, like the Kicks and Sentra, have delivered some nice styling without breaking the budget. Their bigger vehicles, like the Murano and Maxima, look elegant and premium. Unfortunately, the Qashqai has a slightly dated design that doesn’t fit in either of these two camps. While the overall design is bland, there are a few details that are worth highlighting, like the wheel design, integrated turn signals in the mirrors, and the LED light signature up front.

Inside, the Qashqai has a clean design but is missing playful details. That is becoming less forgivable, as other vehicles in this class are getting clever touches like contrasting stitched leather in the upholstery. Top trim models can be equipped with different shades of leather, and a bit of a quilted pattern to show off some level of craftsmanship, but it’s a shame to hide it away on the most expensive models.

User Friendliness: 7.5/10

Furthermore, there are a few missteps with the ergonomics and usability inside the Qashqai that are pretty frustrating. For starters, there is a bank of useful buttons hidden below the driver’s side of the dash. The heated steering wheel controls, steering assistance, and drive modes are all difficult to see and reach. Furthermore, while the infotainment system has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, the USB port to connect your phone is located in a space that is too small for modern smartphones.

However, Nissan should get credit for making its driver assistance features easy to use and understand. A bright blue button on the steering wheel enables the ProPILOT Assist function, and a clear and legible display in the gauge cluster shows what functions are working. It even shows what the car detects with its various sensors, like the car ahead, or the lane markings. Whenever it struggles to pick up one of these items, it provides a soft beep, rather than a harsh warning, as a reminder to the driver to stay vigilant.

Features: 7/10

Qashqai buyers can expect the usual suspects in terms of features and technology. Base models come with heated seats and a few safety features including blind-spot monitoring and high-beam assist. All models come with a seven-inch colour infotainment system, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

You’ll find features like dual-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel, as well as a sunroof, on the SV model – the next step up in the trim levels. Beyond the SV is the SL, which adds features like leather upholstery, a 360-degree camera, bigger wheels, and the ProPILOT Assist driver assistance and safety suite. The SL Platinum gets an upgraded Bose sound system, LED lighting, and a memory function for the driver seat.

Unfortunately, there are no ventilated seats, and Nissan doesn’t offer heated rear seats in this vehicle.

Safety: 8/10

When it comes to safety and driver assistance features, the Qashqai over-delivers. I’m so impressed with the ProPILOT Assist functionality and refinement, which is clearly among the best in the industry, let alone the segment. Only the Crosstrek with its EyeSight suite of driver assistance features is as comprehensive as the Qashqai, and I felt that the Nissan implementation of adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping was more measured and trustworthy; the way it communicates how each component is working is also an advantage.

The Qashqai performed well in crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) but doesn’t yet qualify for an award since its crash avoidance features haven’t been tested.

Comfort: 7/10

In terms of ride comfort, the only significant note is that the 19-inch wheels on my SL trim tester were noticeable on rough roads. Otherwise, the ride is comfortable enough for the commute. When it comes to the seats, they’re nothing special, but they get the job done. Other Nissan models, including the new Sentra, feature very nicely sculpted and supportive front seats that the automaker claims are inspired by NASA, but the Qashqai is left behind. It’s also disappointing to see the Qashqai lacking rear heated seats because the rear seats are spacious for a vehicle in this class. As large as they are, the rear seats are a little less comfortable than the front seats, with a seating position and angle that may be awkward for adults.

Fortunately, there is a heated steering wheel, two-stage heated front seats, and dual-zone climate control. While the interior isn’t especially small, a bigger sunroof would help bring more sunlight into the cabin, which is always nice.

Practicality: 8/10

There’s a slight difference in cargo space depending on whether it’s equipped with a sunroof or not. Base models of the Qashqai offer 648 L in the cargo area with the rear seats in place, while folding those rear seats brings the total to around 1,730 L. If you get a higher trim model with the sunroof you’ll find 566 L with the seats up and 1,500 L with them folded. This makes the Qashqai more spacious than the Kona but it’s ever-so-slightly behind the Crosstrek.

With the seats folded, the loading surface is relatively flat. One unique addition to the Qashqai is the available cargo divider, which can help stash items in the cargo area or make a barrier to prevent things from rolling around.

Value: 7/10

The Qashqai has a wide range of trim levels, starting at a reasonable $21,598 for a front-wheel-drive S model with a manual transmission. Getting a CVT in this configuration will bump the price up to $24,298, while adding AWD will increase the price to $26,298. The next step up in the models is the SV trim, which is also available with front-wheel drive for $26,898, or $28,898 for an AWD model. The SL and SL Platinum models come standard with AWD and are priced at $31,948 and $34,098, respectively. These prices don’t include the destination fee and handling, which is $1,950.

Only the top two trim levels come with ProPILOT Assist, which is the Qashqai’s best feature. It’s easy to recommend these models, but spending over $30,000 on a subcompact crossover isn’t an easy call considering slightly larger models can be found around the same price. For example, the top trims of compact crossovers like the Subaru Forester and Nissan Rogue are priced below $40,000.

The Verdict

With so many excellent subcompact crossovers on the market, it isn’t easy for a newly refreshed model like the Qashqai to make its mark. It’s hard to compete with the likes of the Hyundai Kona and Subaru Crosstrek, but this Nissan offering fills in a few of the gaps left by those vehicles. Thanks to its impressive driver assistance features and spacious interior, it manages to stay afloat in this burgeoning segment.

Las Cruces Sun-News

LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of creating a fictitious identity and using it to fraudulently purchase a brand-new vehicle — and nearly a second one before his arrest.

Richard Padilla, 32, who claimed an address of 999 W. Amador Ave., is charged with one second-degree felony count of fraud more than $20,000, two third-degree felony counts of attempted fraud of more than $20,000, two fourth-degree felony counts of forgery, a fourth-degree felony count of identity theft and a fourth-degree felony count of possession of methamphetamine.

Investigators believe Padilla either stole or obtained stolen mail and used information in it — including a paper driver’s license and a Social Security number — to create a fictitious identification. Investigators learned he used the photo from his driver’s license and copied it to the paper driver’s license that was stolen, creating a realistic-looking paper, or temporary, driver’s license.

Investigators learned Padilla used the fictious paperwork on Sept. 8 to purchase a 2020 Nissan Titan from a local dealership. The Nissan was valued at approximately $60,000. Padilla was trying to purchase a 2020 Ford F-150, valued at approximately $40,000, from another local dealership when he was detained for questioning by Las Cruces police.

Investigators learned Padilla also forged information to create a fake insurance document that was needed to complete the vehicle purchase. Padilla is also suspected of using the fake ID to cash checks.

Police encourage automobile dealerships — and other businesses that require identification cards to facilitate a transaction — to use caution when accepting a paper or temporary driver’s license.

The MoU between the companies was announced today as part of Uber’s announcement to become a zero-emission mobility platform. By 2025, 50% of kilometers driven on Uber’s platform in aggregate across seven European capitals (Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, London, Madrid and Paris) will be in electric vehicles. This will mean that riders will be able to select a zero-emission vehicle in cities representing 80 percent of Uber European business by the end of 2021.

Under the MoU, the companies will now explore how working together can accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and the electric ecosystem in European cities, including efforts to:

Offer partner drivers on the Uber App access to Renault and Nissan electric vehicles: Renault ZOE and Nissan Leaf and future new EVs from both companies.

Extend the United Kingdom pilot into France by the end of 2020, with a view to scaling the program to the Netherlands, Portugal, and other markets.

Launch joint marketing and education plans to promote the electric vehicle offers and benefits to Uber’s partner drivers and offer test drives to allow them to experience the cars.

Jordi Vila, Divisional Vice President for Sales and Marketing at Nissan Europe, added: “From 10 years of experience with the Nissan LEAF, we know people love driving electric, and that making the switch can help drivers to save money and support the clean air ambitions of our major cities. By teaming up with Uber in the UK, we have already been able to increase the awareness and adoption of zero-emission vehicles, and we are looking forward to exploring how to roll that out further in Europe.”

U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell issued a ruling that approved the extradition of Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his son Peter. The Taylors were arrested in May and held in Massachusetts after they were arrested in May of this year.

Attorneys for the father and son did not deny the allegations but argued against extradition on the grounds that their actions were not covered by the law with which Japan is trying to convict them.

Japan plans to charge the pair under Article 103 of the nation’s penal code, which prohibits harboring criminals and enabling the flight of anyone who has committed a crime or escaped confinement, Bloomberg reported.

Japan requested to extradite the pair on charges that they helped former Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee Japan last year, smuggling him in a box onto a private jet that flew to Turkey, then to Lebanon, where Ghosn has citizenship but no extradition treaty with Japan.

Ghosn claims he fled Japan as he would not face a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions.

Because Ghosn was out on bail when he fled, lawyers for the Taylors argue that authorities were not actively pursuing him.

In his ruling, Cabell sided with Japanese and U.S. prosecutors, saying the Taylors’ actions brought them “squarely within the purview” of Article 103. “They harbored or enabled the escape of Carlos Ghosn,” he wrote.

Ghosn stands accused of underreporting his income and diverting Nissan money for personal gain. Records show that he wired more than $800,000 to Peter Taylor in October 2019, and that Ghosen’s son made crypto payments of around $500,000 to Taylor earlier in 2020.

The Taylors have reportedly spent more than $100,000 on lawyers and lobbyists to press their case in Washington, particularly with the White House and State Department.

The final decision as to whether or not the pair will be extradited will rest with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

274,274,274,https://www.autonews.com/legal-file/trial-date-arrives-american-nissan-exec,Trial date arrives for American Nissan exec,"Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest.
Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity.
""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney.
Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.
But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.",13/09/2020,"TOKYO — Nissan's indicted former boss Carlos Ghosn has fled, but the American lieutenant he left behind in Japan — Greg Kelly, accused of being his accomplice — finally heads to court in Tokyo this week in a closely watched case that will bring some measure of closure to the corporate saga.

Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest.

Kelly was released on bail that Christmas but has been required to live in Japan, where he and his lawyers have been plowing through mountains of evidence to prepare for their defense.

Kelly, a human resources manager who climbed Nissan's global executive ladder from its operations in Tennessee, is charged with orchestrating a plan to conceal more than $80 million in deferred remuneration to Ghosn over the 2010-17 fiscal years, resulting in the information not being reported in Nissan's public financial documents.

Ghosn was arrested separately the same day as Kelly in a coordinated sweep by Japanese prosecutors. But Ghosn jumped bail at the end of December 2019 and fled to Lebanon.

If found guilty, Kelly could face up to a decade of prison in Japan.

His trial will be long. It is expected to run through July, with a verdict no earlier than fall 2021.

Also on trial is Nissan Motor Co., as a corporate entity. While Nissan is expected to not contest the charges, Kelly and Ghosn maintain their innocence.

Kelly rose from his job as Nissan's top U.S. human resources executive in Nashville to become an executive vice president with the Renault-Nissan Alliance and eventually a director on Nissan's board in Japan.

He has said that Nissan money earmarked for Ghosn was not part of a scheme to provide deferred compensation. On the contrary, it was a legal draft of a post-retirement contract intended to keep Ghosn as an adviser to the Japanese carmaker and prevent him from bolting to a competitor. Kelly maintains that the amount of the compensation was never fixed, the contracts were never signed, and nothing was ever paid.

""There never was a transaction, nor an agreement consummated,"" said James Wareham, Kelly's U.S.-based defense attorney. ""The statute is laughably obtuse and vague. He is clearly innocent.""

The case is drawing international support for the former Nissan director, who spent the last few years of his career working in Japan for the automaker.

Three U.S. senators published a letter in support of Kelly this year. Sens. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee called Kelly's predicament a ""cautionary tale"" for Americans working in Japan.

As he awaited trial on bail, he was prevented from leaving Japan and has been living in a Tokyo apartment, where he has been joined by his wife from Nashville. In order to stay in Japan, his wife studies Japanese language on a student visa and must maintain high standing or run the risk of losing legal immigration status.

Among those expected to testify at Kelly's trial is former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa.

Ghosn was once pinned as a friendly witness backing Kelly's defense, until he bolted Japan. But Kelly holds no animosity toward his former boss for leaving him to go it alone, Wareham said.

Among the challenges faced by Kelly's legal team are digging through a mountain of evidence and lacking access to dozens more boxes of documents that his attorneys said were being withheld.

The first installment of evidence from prosecutors was an 11-terabyte data dump — equivalent to 1 billion documents.

Since then, prosecutors say they have produced another 84 boxes of materials. But as of a week before trial, some 70 of those boxes had not been shared with Kelly, Wareham said.

Language will be another challenge.

The court has denied Kelly's request for simultaneous interpretation during the proceedings, Wareham added. Instead, interpretation will be consecutive, effectively doubling the trial time.

The long wait between the end of the trial in July and the verdict is another bone of contention.

""Overall, the Japanese legal system is barbaric, outdated and grossly unfair,"" Wareham said.","<div><p class="""">TOKYO &#8212; Nissan's indicted former boss Carlos Ghosn has fled, but the American lieutenant he left behind in Japan &#8212; Greg Kelly, accused of being his accomplice &#8212; finally heads to court in Tokyo this week in a closely watched case that will bring some measure of closure to the corporate saga.</p><p class="""">Kelly's financial misconduct trial begins Tuesday, Sept. 15, the day he turns 64, nearly two years after his November 2018 arrest. </p><p class="""">Kelly was released on bail that Christmas but has been required to live in Japan, where he and his lawyers have been plowing through mountains of evidence to prepare for their defense. </p><p class="""">Kelly, a human resources manager who climbed Nissan's global executive ladder from its operations in Tennessee, is charged with orchestrating a plan to conceal more than $80 million in deferred remuneration to Ghosn over the 2010-17 fiscal years, resulting in the information not being reported in Nissan's public financial documents.</p><p class="""">Ghosn was arrested separately the same day as Kelly in a coordinated sweep by Japanese prosecutors.

Six days before the car is revealed, the latest clip shows a manual lever displaying an H-pattern gearbox layout with six speeds, to the background noise of what’s almost certainly a turbocharged V6 engine being revved. Good news all round, we’d say, even if no actual official information has been supplied.

As mentioned when the last preview video went out (scroll down for earlier stories), the Proto Z is expected to share its underpinnings and motor with Infiniti’s performance saloons. But the fitment of a manual with that circa-400hp engine will make the Proto Z unique in Nissan and its sister brand’s line-up; and a whole lot more attractive to those who prefer the workload of three pedals, especially if they've been longing for a 370Z replacement.

It’s thanks to that old car’s performance and the capability shown by the V6 in Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 that we’re so confident the incoming machine will have around 400hp. That would place it smack bang on par with the Audi TT RS, but thanks to rear-wheel drive – also anticipated because of those Infinitis – and the manual, not to mention the Zed car’s unique design, Nissan’s offering looks well placed to play a more substantial role in the segment. But, pleasingly for us lot, it looks like the focus is first and foremost on the enthusiasts.

Previous story: 07/09/2020

Nine days before Nissan pulls the covers off its Z Proto sports car, the manufacturer has posted a video that seems to show a manual gear lever on the transmission tunnel. Oh yes. The blink-and-you’ll-miss-it clip, presumably there to get us all excited about the Z Proto’s gearbox, features an actor’s hand that grabs a lever in the manner of a manual ‘box. It’s the first potentially tangible piece of evidence to back all of the speculation behind Nissan’s upcoming two-door.

The car is also expected to come with a turbocharged V6 engine, borrowed from Infiniti’s Q50 and Q60 performance models with a circa 400hp output. The platform itself is also expected to be shared with those models, making us pretty confident that the Z Proto will be rear-drive, too. A V6-powered, manual rear-drive coupe from Japan is something everyone, not just fans of the Zed lineage, can understand the significance of, especially in 2020.

Aside from the gearbox hint, today’s video does little to prove or disprove the predictions for the model’s technical setup. Earlier previews have shown that its two-door body will place its occupants in the middle, behind an extended bonnet and in front of a taut rear-end. That bodes well for balance and weight distribution, and while much of it looks new, we spot some design influences from the car's forebears, particularly at the rear.

It all has us very excited for what's to come. Rest assured we'll be keeping a close eye on Nissan’s digital channels for any more information in the coming days. All things suggest the 16th September reveal will be one well worth tuning in for.

Original story: 01.09.2020

It's been a long time coming, but now there is confirmation from Nissan that the next Zed sports car - or the Z Proto preview, at least - isn't that far off: all will be revealed on September 16th.

Which, for those of us seduced by front-engined, rear-drive, six-cylinder Nissan sports cars over the past half a century, is excellent news. Because not only have there been some real heroes over the past 50 years - the original 240 and the 350 of 2003 spring to mind - we've been waiting an eternity for a new one. There are 370Zs out there on an '09 plate, fundamentally the same package as is still available with a 2020 registration. And the Zed wasn't without flaws in the first decade of the 21st century, so it's desperately due an overhaul now.

Hopefully this Z Proto will give a good indication on what to expect; all that's seen of it in this video is the vaguest of silhouette and headlight profiles. The vid is instead dedicated to the Zed history, the enormous of amount of heritage and success that Nissan will hope to influence the new car with. Because while there have been some less than great Zed cars, if this new one can combine the best attributes of the good'ns - brawny performance, great looks, fun handling - then you'd have to assume that Nissan would be on to something. Even if the commonly accepted idea of a coupe nowadays seems to have a raised ride height and a kerbweight in excess of two tonnes.

Whether it's a 400Z, electrified or not, a conventional two seater or 2+2, the right blend of Zed characteristics will surely see Nissan right in a new car. We won't know anything more about that car for a couple of weeks, though; best then to settle in and bask in the Nissan sports car heritage. And if 58 seconds is insufficient, then there's definitely permission granted to watch Tokyo Drift as well; after all, it's not every day a new Nissan Zed car is announced...","<div><p class=""&#127950;2uDbQu &#127950;16v_t3""></p><img alt="""" src="""" class=""&#127950;1OycdU &#127950;2lg8qm""><p>Nissan has all but confirmed that its upcoming Proto Z sports car will use a manual and turbocharged V6 in its latest preview video.

There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997.
The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation.
1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours.
Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.",14/09/2020,"Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!

John’s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race’s ‘coulda, shoulda, woulda’ programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.

The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later. I had a look at Toyota’s effort a week or so ago, and in the shadow of this year’s great race, it also appropriate to consider another contender of the time, the Nissan R390.

After the demise of Group C and IMSA GTP in 1992 and 1993, the rules were structured to make the GT category more in tune with road cars, so the Japanese manufacturers responded by building GT versions of the Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Honda NSX and of course the Toyota Supra LM. These true road car evolutions were outclassed by the McLaren F1 GTR at Le Mans in 1995; not entirely unexpected given the philosophy behind Woking’s finest.

Frustrated by the multiple successes of the F1 GTR on the tracks during the BPR era of 1995 and 1996, Porsche brought a gun to the knife fight with the introduction of their 911 GT1. So it was clear that to have any prospect of success, a supercar would have to be designed and built and in double quick time too. There was only one way to achieve this task and get the project ready to run at Le Mans in mid-1997. Get the car designed and built by one of the specialists and who better than Tom Walkinshaw Racing? TWR had a record second to none in running motorsport projects for manufacturers, especially at Le Mans, where their outright wins in 1988 and 1990 for Jaguar had passed into legend.

So when Nissan wanted an answer to the question of what to do next in pursuit of victory at Le Mans the answer was to engage TWR. In addition to TWR’s experience on the track, the company still had the services of Tony Southgate, who had designed the successful Jaguars of the Group C/IMSA era. As Project Leader for TWR, Southgate came up with a state of the art chassis and bodywork made of composite materials, carbon fibre and kevlar.

Adding complexity to the whole project was the requirement to produce a road car that could be sold to the public. TWR Design was headed by Ian Callum, designer/creator of the Aston Martin DB7 and he styled and oversaw the production of the Nissan R390 road car, the fastest and most expensive road car ever produced by Nissan. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz GT1 project, Nissan created the road car first and thereby conformed to the spirit as well as the letter of the regulations. It was all in vain though, as the rules changed just before the start of the season allowing the road car to be produced any time during the calendar year. Mercedes-Benz showed their contempt for the process by unveiling their street-legal version of the CLK GTR in late December, months after the FIA GT Championship had been run and won.

Callum made styling references to the rest of the Nissan product range and heritage, using the twin front grills that gave a subliminal message “Nissan” and also the headlights had their origins in the 300SX. There were only two examples of the R390 built for the public highway, with a 0-60mph time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 220moh, all at a price tag of $1 million.

Nissan, or more accurately, NISMO rummaged around the back of the engine storeroom and found the V8 that used to power the 1990 Group C Le Mans entries. This 3.5 litre twin turbo V8, codenamed VRH35L, had been extensively updated since its previous visit to La Sarthe to cope with the new demands imposed by air restrictors, especially in the area of friction reduction. The engine had two overhead camshafts per bank of cylinders with 32 valves in total. There were 2 IHI turbos and the power “over 600bhp” was sent to the rear wheels through a transversally mounted six speed sequential gearbox designed and built by X-Trac. Tyres were provided by Bridgestone.

The final piece of the jigsaw was to assemble the team for the attempt on the world’s greatest race. Nissan had failed in their previous attempts on the French classic, most notably in 1990 when despite having the best car, political in-fighting and lack of co-operation between the British, American and Japanese teams (yes three separate teams!) they conspired to lose the race to Jaguar and TWR. This time things would be different.

While Tony Southgate headed up the TWR side of the operation, Tom Walkinshaw himself being on Grand Prix duty with Arrows, Kunihiko Kakimoto was Nissan and NISMO’s man in charge. For the race, there were 115 members of the team, 40 from TWR and the rest from Japan.

The team had a very strong pool of drivers available to them. Number 21 had TWR’s favourite son, Martin Brundle, with Jörg Müller and Wayne Taylor, a late substitute for the injured Mauro Martini, joining him behind the wheel. Number 22 was crewed by Riccardo Patrese, Aguri Suzuki and Eric Van de Poele. The third R390, number 23, had Eric Comas, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama on driving duties.

The attraction of the World’s Greatest Race is attested by the number of entries, always in excess of the track’s licensed limit. 1997 was no exception with 86 applications which the Selection Committee of the ACO whittled down to 76. These were invited to turn up at the beginning of May to see who would go forward to the race itself. One entry dropped out, six were granted exemption by virtue of 1995 results, so 69 cars scrapped for the 46 places on pit road during race week itself, some six weeks hence. Oh, and of those 46, four would go home early, all nice and clear.

For factory teams such as Nissan, this system gave a few sleepless nights, as if they did not achieve the right level of performance on the day then it was no race after all that effort and expense.

The cars were split up into two groups, one running on Saturday, the balance on Sunday. Everyone in the paddock was given a reminder of the ever-present dangers in the sport when an accident on Saturday claimed the life of the promising young French driver, Sebastian Enjolras. There was little enthusiasm for running during the rest of the day. The timesheets were topped by the McLaren F1 GTR of JJ Lehto with 3:45.973. The #22 Nissan was around three seconds back but comfortably in the race.

The pace hotted up on Sunday and as usual, the teams all put on stickier rubber as the clock ticked towards the end of the session and no one wanted to be left standing when the music stopped. For #21 there would be no worries as Martin Brundle was in outstanding form, scorching round in 3:43.152 to record the fastest time of the weekend. To complete a good weekend for the Anglo-Japanese team #23 was also in with ease. Quiet satisfaction and a job list of improvements to be made were the conclusions taken away – next up, the race!

Fastest in the Pre-Qualifying Weekend, the mood in the TWR Nissan camp would have been reasonably confident. Or it should have been: those of us on the outside had heard that there had been a successful three-day test at Magny Cours and all was plain sailing.

The more observant (not me, I hasten to add) would have questioned why the exhaust system had been re-routed from back to side, not something lightly undertaken. The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.

It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR “forgot” this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.

Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut’s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.

The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.

Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah… TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.

R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. “Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.”

Prophetic words…

Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.

As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.

“The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,” was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.

The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.

All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.

A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. “I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,” said Erik Comas. “It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.” Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.

During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with “a serious gearbox” problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.

At 4.24 am Jörg Müller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: “I agreed with my engineer that we’d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.”

What might have been… two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.

Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: “Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish”.

Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.

It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: “I believe we proved the Nissan car’s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.”

So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?

A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.

There were three ’98 spec cars and one ’97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.

The fourth R390 was the ’97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new ’98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.

As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.

In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: “I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.” He had also earned a drive in the race itself.

Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.

The simple answer was no.

Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the ’97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.

1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.

For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.

The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.

Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.

So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998’s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.

The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle’s Toyota and Schneider’s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.

In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan’s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider’s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.

Next, it was BMW’s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.

So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.

At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.

Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.

Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390’s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.

Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; Müller having a spin, damaging the Porsche’s undertray and McNish’s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.

Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.

And so that’s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan’s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.

So much for the good news.

The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:

Tokyo … Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.

Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan’s motorsports arm in August.

The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.

Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.

The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.","<div><p><strong>Our second feature offering in Le Mans Week from the DSC archive comes from John Brooks, writer, photographer and much more!</strong></p><br /><p>John&#8217;s archive from the days of GT1 is matchless, and here he puts the words with the pictures to look back at one of the Great Race&#8217;s &#8216;coulda, shoulda, woulda&#8217; programmes, the TWR developed Nissan R390.</p><br /><p>The second half of the final decade of the 20th Century saw at Le Mans the arrival of a bunch of SuperCars that still are breathtaking all these years later.

The answer lay with the annual dust-up between the ACO and TWR over an interpretation of the rules.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277429"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>It is completely obvious to anyone who glances at the Nissan R390, it is a road car that has been converted to track use. So like all road cars it will have a luggage compartment somewhere and by the 1997 ACO rules, this space had to have a volume of at least 150 litres. At this point the story becomes hazy. Some accounts say that TWR &#8220;forgot&#8221; this requirement; I would suggest this unlikely, knowing the people involved. A more likely tale is that the original version of the luggage space was flexible but the ACO intended it to be rigid and as anyone who has disagreed with the ACO can attest they can be really rigid when the mood takes them. All that is clear is that the technical department of the ACO, headed up by Daniel Perdrix had TWR move the exhausts.</p><br /><p>Seasoned observers speculated that the affair was the latest chapter in the long-running saga of disagreement between TWR and Alain Bertaut. Mr Bertaut&#8217;s title as President of the Stewards of the Meeting did not reveal the extent of his influence in every aspect of Les Vingt-Quatre Heures du Mans. Getting on the wrong side of this all powerful man could have dire consequences for any aspiring competitor at La Sarthe, as TWR and Nissan were about to experience.</p><br /><p>The Dog and Pony Show in the Place des Jacobins came and went, teams posed and photographers snapped. Then it was time to hit the track on Wednesday and Thursday to establish the final pecking order. After the fine performance in May, much was expected.</p><br /><p>Wednesday brought disappointment though, with the cars lining up 7th, 15th and 17th on the timesheets. Oil on the track, heavy traffic, blah, blah blah&#8230; TWR was too good for those sorts of excuses. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the press release.</p><br /><p>R390 GT1 Project Director Kunihiko Kakimoto was optimistic after first qualifying at Le Mans. &#8220;Our cars specifications were greatly modified since pre-qualifying and we did not have enough time to test thoroughly. I am convinced that the cars will perform perfectly tomorrow, just as they did in Pre-Qualifying.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Prophetic words&#8230;</p><br /><p>Thursday was better, Eric Van de Poele put his R390 on the second row of the grid with a third fastest time of 3:45.324. Four places back were Martin Brundle and the third Nissan was 21st after a troubled second evening. This was not the performance that had been anticipated. The team had slipped by two seconds, whereas the Joest Porsche LMP had improved its time by a similar margin to 3:41.581. The figures did not stack up: something was going seriously wrong.</p><br /><p>As the field streamed away from the line to commence the twice round the clock classic it was assumed that things would get better for the race-hardened TWR team. Van de Poele in #22 pushed to the limit during the first two hours, leading the race on lap 14 and running in the top five overall for the first three hours, while matching the pace of the other front runners, the Porsche 911 GT1s and the TWR Joest LMP. Then the problems began.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277430"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""675""></a></p><br /><p>&#8220;The car was running absolutely perfectly and was as fast as many of the lighter prototype cars, which was encouraging. Unfortunately, after I had handed over to Aguri Suzuki, there was a split in the gearbox oil cooler. There is a long way to go and even with these problems I am sure we can finish strongly,&#8221; was how Eric Van de Poele saw it.</p><br /><p>The news was no better for #21 which suffered a repeat of clutch problems that had afflicted it during the pre-race warm-up session. After a 1 hour 44 minute pit stop to replace the clutch the R390 restarted in 35th place. Within an hour the car was back in the pits to have a faulty gearbox oil cooler replaced.</p><br /><p>All the cars were suffering from the same problem. The re-routed engine exhausts were causing the gearbox oil coolers to overheat to the point that the solder on the tanks were melting. This was not a problem that could be sorted out with a quick fix. It was a disaster for Nissan and TWR.</p><br /><p>A bit of preventative maintenance meant that #23 mitigated the worst effects of the oil cooler issue and the R390 ran in the top ten until around 1.00 am when the afflictions that had done for the other cars finally prevailed. &#8220;I heard a big noise and I knew something was wrong with the gearbox,&#8221; said Erik Comas. &#8220;It was thought at first only a change of ratios was needed but the whole gearbox was ultimately changed. At the same time the brake discs and pads, as well as a side panel, were all changed.&#8221; Two hours later Kagayama took the car back into the race but any challenge from #23 had evaporated. At least they were still running.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277431"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-7.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>During the middle of the #23 pitstop, Auguri Suzuki brought in #22 with &#8220;a serious gearbox&#8221; problem. Spares were running out and the car was retired to conserve resources for the remaining two R390s.</p><br /><p>At 4.24 am J&#246;rg M&#252;ller limped back to the pits with accident damage to #21, adding to the transmission woes. He explained later: &#8220;I agreed with my engineer that we&#8217;d go for a few quick laps to try to make up some time, but I hit the apex on the first chicane and ran over the kerb damaging the underside of the car. The damage in addition to the gearbox cooler problems made it impossible to go on. It has been very frustrating because without the gearbox trouble the cars have run perfectly and have been very fast. We could have been celebrating a good result here.&#8221;</p><br /><p>What might have been&#8230; two Nissans down and the sun was not yet up.</p><br /><p>Comas, Kagayama and Hoshino persisted with #23 dragging the car from 24th to an eventual finish of 12th, this despite another gearbox change at 12 noon. The transmission problems made the car hard to drive as Kagayama disclosed: &#8220;Second gear is very difficult to select and so I have only been using gears three to six. As the other Nissan cars have retired now we are keener than ever to finish&#8221;.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277432"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1997-8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Getting across the finishing line was some small reward for all the hard work of the team. A finish at Le Mans is always a kind of victory, it helps soothe the emotions.</p><br /><p>It was left to Kunihiko Kakimoto, to sum up, the race for the team: &#8220;I believe we proved the Nissan car&#8217;s impressive performance and potential by obtaining the top pre-qualification time. During the race, we encountered difficulties that we had not previously experienced. It is however very encouraging that car 23 could complete the race by overcoming all the difficulties. With the experience we accumulated this year, we believe we will be a strong contender for an outright win at this classic race in 1998.&#8221;</p><br /><p>So Nissan and TWR would be back in 1998, things could only get better, surely?</p><br /><p>A new year brought fresh inspiration to the Nissan and TWR R390 project. The disaster of the 1997 Le Mans race was analysed and the car underwent a transformation. The length of the R390 grew by 13 centimetres, the rear wing was repositioned and the aerodynamics were altered to improve airflow over the rear. Most importantly the transmission was changed. The X-Trac casing was retained but all the internals were now from Nissan themselves. The brakes were also new including an ABS system.</p><br /><p>There were three &#8217;98 spec cars and one &#8217;97 chassis entered by Nissan Motorsports. The driver line up also changed with #30 having John Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and late replacement, Michael Krumm; #31 had Jan Lammers, Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini. Nielsen and Lammers were both former winners with TWR and Jaguar. The #32 was an all Japanese affair featuring Aguri Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Masahiko Kagayama returning to La Sarthe to race once again for Nissan. A good balance of speed and experience with no weak links in the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277433"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>The fourth R390 was the &#8217;97 car that Patrese, Van de Poele and Suzuki had led the race with. It had been updated with the new &#8217;98 spec gearbox and bodywork. It was run for Nissan by Nova Engineering and had another all-Japanese crew, Satoshi Motoyama, Masemi Kagayama and Takuya Kurosawa on driving duties.</p><br /><p>As in 1997, there was a Pre-Qualifying Weekend held during early May and the three factory cars all got through comfortably enough. The session was reduced to just the Sunday and cars either ran in the morning or afternoon. Damp conditions early on meant that the scramble for positions happened in earnest during the final 30 minutes of the session. When the dust had settled Franck Lagorce in #30 ended up second overall with a time of 3:40:926 and Aguri Suzuki was third, precisely one-hundredth of a second behind him in #33.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon session, Erik Comas ended up fifth with 3:40.778 for #31. The real excitement lay with #33 which was out of the race until the last lap of the session when Satoshi Motoyama put in an absolute flyer to squeeze out the Zakspeed Porsche. He was calm about his achievement: &#8220;I was radioed from the pits that it was the last lap, which meant I had one final chance to attack, but I tried not to think about it and just did my best.&#8221; He had also earned a drive in the race itself.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277434"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Once again the teams and drivers lined up for the portrait session in the Place des Jacobins with Nissan getting some very welcome support from the crowd. The question was: Would the R390 be quick enough to stay with the new generation of GT1 cars from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Toyota? It was thought that they would be reliable because the work that had been done in the previous 12 months would ensure that there would be no repeat of the horrors of 1997.</p><br /><p>The simple answer was no.</p><br /><p>Bernd Schneider claimed pole position in his Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM at 3:35.544, a whole 7.8 seconds faster than the 1997 GT1 best. Lagorce in #30 managed a lap of 3:40.649 with Lammers getting down to 3:41.621 in #31, Suzuki 3:42.397 in #32 and Kurosawa bringing the &#8217;97 spec car in at 3:45.293. So the Nissans would line up in 10th, 13th, 14th and 19th. Would that do? Would the reliability card be enough to bring the project the success that it so desperately needed? The answer to that question was different depending on who you asked.</p><br /><p>1998 was indeed a year of transition in how manufacturers went racing at Le Mans for 24 hours. Until that point teams would nurse cars along to get to the finish, although of course there had to be a certain amount of speed. Major manufacturer participation in the race had ended in 1993 with the passing of the 3.5-litre Group C cars and for the next four years, the race would be won by private teams, even though there were varying degrees of back door support.</p><br /><p>For 1998 there were full-blown factory efforts from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW as well as Nissan, all of whom developed new cars. It was also a time when the quality control practices that had been established in Formula One and World Rally became fully established in endurance racing.</p><br /><p>The R390 had improved by around 5 seconds a lap year on year but it had been derived from a street car, however extreme, and that did put certain compromises on ultimate performance. The CLK-LM, 911 GT1 98 and the GT-One were pure racing cars and that would give them a speed margin over the Nissan.</p><br /><p>Talking to Allan McNish about this period he said that 1998 was the year that everyone was forced to race flat out right from the beginning of the race; with the pace of the new GT1 cars there was no alternative. There were too many good cars around and in his case the Porsche was relatively easy to drive at the maximum and it was bullet proof.</p><br /><p>So tenth place on the grid for Nissan was probably as good a performance as could be expected, behind 2 Mercedes, 2 Porsches and 3 Toyotas and a couple of LMPs. Another way of looking at the massive leap in performance on the previous year was to consider that in 1997 only the top two cars qualified in the 3:40 to 3:45 bracket. For 1998&#8217;s race there were 22 in that time zone, with a further 7 in the next category up, 3:35 to 3:40. This was the essential problem that the R390 faced, 1997 levels of speed were just not quick enough.</p><br /><p>The race got underway and the Nissan quartet played no part in the early battles for the lead Brundle&#8217;s Toyota and Schneider&#8217;s Mercedes leading Martini in the BMW and McNish in the Porsche. At the one hour point, the R390s were all on the lead lap and in the top 20.</p><br /><p>In the second hour, things began to swing Nissan&#8217;s way as on the 19th lap as Bernd Schneider&#8217;s CLK-LM stopped just past the pits. A problem with the power steering oil pump meant that the whole engine lubrication system failed and the car was retired on the spot. A few laps later and Jean-Marc Gounon brought the sister Mercedes into the pits suffering from the same terminal condition; two leaders down and out.</p><br /><p>Next, it was BMW&#8217;s turn to have an embarrassing failure. Both LMPs were withdrawn before the fourth hour with wheel bearing failures predicted: no one wanted to risk a massive accident, so that was another two leaders out.</p><br /><p>So now it was the three Toyotas and the two Porsches battling for supremacy. Then the Toyota armada hit problems, Suzuki in #27 had a transmission problem that dropped them down the order as did Helary in #28 who had issues with the brakes as well as the transmission.</p><br /><p>At the fourth hour #30 was 4th, #31 5th, #32 9th and #33 11th. This was getting interesting for Nissan.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277435"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>Into the dark, the #30 kept up the chase but the #31 lost six laps having to replace the front hub carrier. The other two R390s were chugging along, just not able to live with the Porsche/Toyota express. Just before midnight the #29 Toyota had gear cluster problems and the stop to rectify this cost four laps, leaving #30 third, three laps down on the Porsches. Number 31 lost more time when Lammers fell off the track at the Porsche Curves, repairs dropping the car out of the top ten and put it eleven laps down on the leader.</p><br /><p>Rain fell on part of the track during the darkness of the early morning, the wet/dry conditions made driving especially difficult on such a long lap. Masemi Kagayama skated off at Porsche Curves, inflicting severe damage on the #33 R390&#8217;s left-hand side. Repairs took an hour and a half, pitching the car down to 24th.</p><br /><p>Nissan number 30 lost 15 minutes in the night with a fuel pump problem, which promoted #32 to fourth. There were sundry other delays including #32 and #33 colliding in the pit lane, all of which meant that the R390 squad were not in a position to capitalise when the two Porsche 911 GT1 98s hit problems; M&#252;ller having a spin, damaging the Porsche&#8217;s undertray and McNish&#8217;s engine suffering a water leak, costing both cars time in the pits.</p><br /><p>Further niggling problems to #30, such as fitting a new rear wing and screwing up the flat bottom dropped the car further down the order. #32 was running fourth, which became third in the final two hours when the surviving Toyota gave up the ghost and the lead to the two Porsches and a podium beckoned for the team.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277436"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>And so that&#8217;s how it turned out, third place and podium finish for the Japanese trio of Aguri Suzuki, Masahiko Kagayama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino. Adding to the sense of relief that Nissan&#8217;s management must have felt in getting some sort of reward the other three R390s into 5th, 6th and 10th places.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277437"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br /><p>So much for the good news.</p><br /><p>The reality is that this was a disappointing performance from the team. Salvaging a third place was a just reward for all the efforts of TWR, NISMO and Nissan but all would admit that they all had aimed for the top spot on the podium and except for a few hours early in the race in 1997 never looked like getting there. Two weeks after the race a brief press release was issued:</p><br /><p>Tokyo &#8230; Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that the company, upon mutual agreement, has decided not to renew its two-year contract with the British engineering firm TWR at the end of July as planned. Under the contract, Nissan jointly developed the Nissan R390GT1 with TWR and participated in the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 1997 and 1998.</p><br /><p>Activities under this Le Mans project that have been carried out in the U.K., will be transferred to Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd., (NISMO), Nissan&#8217;s motorsports arm in August.</p><br /><p>The dream was over and this time it was also the end of TWR and Le Mans. Nissan returned to La Sarthe in 1999 with the R391 prototype but a massive accident involving Eric Van de Poele on Wednesday practice meant that only one car started and this retired early on. The R391 did get one more outing defeating the Toyota GT-One in the Fuji 1000 Kilometres later that year.</p><br /><p>Away from the tracks, Nissan was facing all manner of financial problems and new boss Carlos Ghosn had no hesitation in stopping a costly racing programme that had only yielded one victory in five years.</p><br /><p>The Nissan R390 was an elegant car conceived to win Le Mans under one set of circumstances but failed to keep pace with the developments in the rules and the cars that the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche were prepared to make.</p><br /><p><a href=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-277438"" src=""http://www.dailysportscar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nissan-R390-Le-Mans-1998-6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""450""></a></p><br />        </div>",0.083,0.079,0.9114,LW6cFqLGSQJGBuRVMzwE2G,,

The special final edition model will be even rarer. Only 20 will reportedly be built and if you want one, you'd better be prepared to pay at least 40 million yen (approximately $378,530). The 2021 Nissan GT-R tops out at $212,435 for the Nismo model while the GT-R50 by Italdesign cost a cool $1.1 million.

When might we see the final edition model? It will reportedly land in 2022, which means it will likely arrive as a 2023 model if sold in the United States.

Do you think the Z Proto should have a manual transmission?",08/09/2020,"After years of waiting, we're now under two weeks away from seeing Nissan's replacement for the aging 370Z, the Z Proto. In an effort to drum up hype for the car, Nissan has been releasing teaser videos giving us glimpses of its retro-inspired design. This latest clip is the most exciting yet, because it hints at the possibility of a manual transmission.

The 30-second teaser, uploaded to Nissan's YouTube channel yesterday, shows us rear light clusters inspired by the 300ZX, and body lines taken from the original 240Z. But the most interesting part of the video comes near the end, where a driver is shown reaching for what seems to be a shift knob placed in the center console.

Granted, we're not ever shown what the shifter looks like, so for all we know, it could just be an automatic gear selector that Nissan is teasing. Though considering the car's sporting intentions, we're hopeful it's not.

Nissan's been coy on what'll sit under the hood of the Z Proto, but rumors have suggested it could be powered by a 400-hp twin-turbo V-6. We'll know for sure on September 15. In the meantime, head on over to our roundup post for the new Z to read up on everything else we know about the car so far.

Do you think the Z Proto should have a manual transmission? Would that entice you to buy it over something like a new Supra? Let us know in the comments.

Are benefits available with all Nissan Kicks variants this month?

All eight versions – three engine-gearbox options and four trim levels – are available with the same benefits. The Kicks now has two petrol engine options – a 106hp, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated unit and a 156hp, 1.3-litre turbo-petrol mill. The former gets a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard while the latter is available with 6-speed manual and CVT automatic options. We’ve driven the Kicks turbo in manual form and came away impressed with its low- and mid-range punch.

Nissan Kicks prices (Rs 9.50-10.00 lakh for the 1.5 petrol and Rs 11.85-14.15 lakh for the 1.3 turbo petrol) are competitive for its class, which includes rivals like the Renault Duster, Kia Seltos, Hyundai Creta and Maruti Suzuki S-Cross.

The hefty government guarantee suggests financial firms are cautious about helping to fund the automaker as it seeks to return to profitability and stop bleeding cash.

The government has guaranteed 104 billion yen of the 180 billion in loans from the DBJ, said the source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the information is not public.

DBJ and Nissan declined to comment. The Ministry of Finance could not immediately be reached for comment.

Three other sources told Reuters in May the government would guarantee part of a loan from Mizuho Financial Group Inc , aimed at helping Nissan ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nissan has also secured 120 billion yen from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and 50 billion yen from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group , the sources previously told Reuters. The government has not guaranteed any portion of these loans, the sources said.

Nissan had pledged to slice 300 billion yen from annual fixed costs and become a smaller, more efficient company after the pandemic exacerbated a slide in profitability that culminated in its first annual loss since fiscal 2008 in the year ended March.

The firm added: ""We have not yet announced a date for the next-generation model, but look forward to sharing some exciting news in the coming months.""

The FT indicated that the apparent delay is largely due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed development and changed the firm's priorities. It suggested the delay could also allow Nissan to work out its course of action should Britain not secure a deal with the European Union post-Brexit.

Just over half of the approximately 500,000 cars produced at Sunderland annually are exported to Europe, and two-thirds of those are Qashqais. Any trade tariffs with the EU would ""jeopardise"" Sunderland's business model, bosses have previously claimed.

The report suggests that production of the new Qashqai will not begin until after April 2021. The current version has been on sale since 2014.

Reveal set for September 16

The ageing Nissan 370Z sports car will soon be replaced by an all-new model, likely called the 400Z. Nissan will reveal a concept for the new car (called the Z Proto) on September 16th and has released numerous teasers giving you an idea of what to expect from its new Toyota Supra rival.

Many of these hints have come in the form of a promotional video, embedded above. While they are quite indistinct, they do show the car will feature similar proportions to Z-cars of the past, including the 240z, 300ZX, 350Z and 370Z.

The Z Proto’s headlights will take inspiration from the classic 240Z.

As such, you can expect it to come with a long bonnet, heavily raked windscreen, two-door design and circular daytime-running lights that mimic the round headlights fitted to the classic 240Z sportscar from the 1970s.

This sketch has echos of the ’90s 300ZX sports car.

An official drawing of the new car’s rear end shared on Instagram by Nissan’s Vice-President of global design appears to show a strong design influence from the 300ZX sports car of the early 1990s.

Nothing beats a manual sports car, especially when it’s the next generation of the #NissanZ. The Nissan Z Proto will be revealed Sept. 16 tune in at https://t.co/au2QTqVwAa pic.twitter.com/FQEffsHdQs — Nissan Australia (@Nissan_Aus) September 10, 2020

A tweet from Nissan’s Australian division gives you a chance to hear the new car’s engine for the first time. The Z Proto and 400Z are expected to come with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine and the smooth, yet slightly muted, revs of the car in the video supports this. Adding turbochargers means Nissan can downsize the new car’s engine without sacrificing any power. Expect the new Z to come with a 3.0-litre engine producing more power than the outgoing Nissan 370Z’s 328hp 3.7-litre unit.

This image confirms the new Z will come with a manual gearbox.

Like the outgoing Nissan 370Z, and the 350Z before that, the new 400Z will come with a manual gearbox – something of a rarity these days. However, you’ll almost certainly be able to pay extra to get an automatic gearbox if you’d prefer.

You’ll probably have to wait until 2023 to get your hands on the new Z.

Nissan 400Z price and release date

When it goes on sale either in 2022 or early in 2023, the new Z will give Nissan a direct rival for the popular Toyota Supra, reigniting a battle first seen in the 1980s and 1990s. Nissan will reveal the full Z Proto concept online at 01:30 am on September 16. The new Z will likely cost more than the £30,000 outgoing car, partly as a result of having a twin-turbo, rather than naturally aspirated, engine.

Making half-a-million of any type of vehicle is impressive, but this plucky little Japanese EV has captured the hearts and minds of consumers as a genuinely viable alternative to gasoline vehicles.

Just ask Maria Jensen of Norway, who purchased the 500,000th example.

“My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it. We’re very excited to become the proud owners of the 500,000th Nissan Leaf. This car really meets our needs with extended range and enhanced technologies.”

The Leaf has been in production since 2011, and since then earned its place as the world’s best-selling electric car. (It was overtaken only recently by the Tesla Model 3, which crossed a half-million units earlier this year.) In 2014 the Leaf surpassed the 100,000-unit mark, with 200,000 units sold the following year. 2018 and 2019 would see Leaf production reach 300,000 and 400,000, respectively.

The 500,000th Leaf was manufactured in Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, England. The current-gen car features a 40- to 62-kWh 350V lithium-ion battery depending on the spec, and produces between 147 and 214 horsepower. Battery-only range is 243 to 363 kilometres, at a base cost of CDN$41,898.","<div><p id=""gpt-bigboxmid"" class=""pn_dfpads adslot""> <br /></p><br /><p>Wednesday, September 9, 2020 marked the inaugural World EV Day, and in an excellent coincidence, Nissan just completed building its 500,000th Leaf, one of the world&#8217;s most popular EVs.</p><p>Making half-a-million of any type of vehicle is impressive, but this plucky little Japanese EV has captured the hearts and minds of consumers as a genuinely viable alternative to gasoline vehicles.</p><p>Just ask Maria Jensen of Norway, who purchased the 500,000th example.</p><p id=""gpt-why-not-consider-ad"" class=""pn_dfpads adslot""> <br /></p><br /><p>&#8220;My husband and I chose to buy a Nissan Leaf back in 2018, and we loved it.

The news for the next-generation Micra came from Nissan’s Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta during an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.
“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.
The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants.
Note: Current Nissan Micra pictured",13/09/2020,"Renault will be responsible for the development and production of the next-generation Nissan Micra as part of the Alliance’s plan for tighter cooperation between its brands.

The current Micra is already being manufactured at Renault’s Flins factory in France, but the facility is expected to phase out vehicle assembly and focus instead on recycling activities from around 2024.

The news for the next-generation Micra came from Nissan’s Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta during an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.

Gupta said that the plan for Nissan’s Ford Fiesta and VW Polo rival is part of the new ‘leader-follower’ strategy within the Alliance, which stipulates that one automaker takes the lead on specific model segments.

“For the next generation of Micra, we will follow Renault, and we will ask Renault to develop and make the future Micra for us,” Gupta said.

The ‘leader-follower’ strategy will also put Renault in charge of the Alliance’s future small B-SUV models, such as the Renault Captur and Nissan Juke, for Europe, while Nissan will lead in the next-generation of C-SUV models, like the Qashqai (Rogue Sport in NA) and its sister model, the Renault Kadjar.

The current Micra has been in the market since late 2016, offered in both petrol and diesel variants. The range-topping variant is the Micra N-Line, which is powered by a turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder with 115 HP paired to a six-speed manual transmission.

Ready to buy a Nissan Titan or Ram 1500?",12/09/2020,"The 2020 Nissan Titan is a new, yet established competitor in the half-ton pickup market that goes up against the 2020 Ram 1500. Let’s see how they compare.

2020 Nissan Titan





2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab Starting Price: $40,485 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; good towing capability; available 4WD; serious off-road chops in Pro-4X trim, long warranty.

Below Average: Only one drivetrain offered; high entry-level price; aging chassis and design.

Consensus: Capable and refined, the Titan offers a powerful V8 as its only drivetrain choice. With a single wheelbase for crew cab models and only five trim levels, Nissan offers a much simpler approach to the new truck buying process.

2020 Ram 1500





2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Starting Price: $33,590 | Price yours or View listings near you

Above Average: Styling; hybrid engine option; coil spring and air suspension; ride quality; rear-seat legroom.

Below Average: Upper trims get expensive; limited powertrain choices; 8- instead of a 10-speed transmission.

Consensus: The Ram offers a bold exterior without going overboard. It also offers numerous unique options like an air suspension and a massive 12-inch touch-screen infotainment setup. There’s plenty of powertrains and trims from which to choose.

Titan vs. Ram 1500: Old newcomer or new oldtimer

Nissan Titan Crew Cab

Nissan has a short history of building full-size pickups. And yet its 2020 Titan, despite a recent facelift, is older than the newly redesigned Ram 1500. As a newcomer, the Titan brings some car-buying sensibility to the truck market. Rather than offering a confusing array of drivetrains, wheelbase lengths, and packages, the Titan is much more straightforward with a single 400-horsepower V8 and 9-speed automatic drivetrain, one wheelbase length and only five trim levels. While it makes things simple, it also limits your choice. At its entry point, the Titan is thousands more than the Ram. Titan does offer a wide range of equipment from the Spartan S model up through the plush Platinum Reserve. Of special note is the off-road 4-wheel drive Pro-4X version that offers serious off-road capability. Another plus is a standard suite of driver and safety assists.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab

The Ram, fresh off a 2019 makeover, offers handsome styling, an impressive number of trims and features, and improved towing and payload numbers. The base engine is a mild hybrid 3.6-liter V6 called eTorque. That same tech is available on the workhorse 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which helps boost that model’s fuel economy numbers. The big thing that separates the Ram from other pickups is its use of a coil-spring independent rear suspension. Even in base form without the optional airbag suspension, this setup imparts a great ride without sacrificing towing or load-carrying capability. We also like the user-friendly Uconnect infotainment system. Like the Titan, there’s plenty of upscale trims to turn your workhorse into a showhorse, but you’ll pay a pretty penny. Some of that investment will be returned due to the Ram’s proven durability and good resale.

Similarities

Expansive model ranges with rear- and 4-wheel drive; top ranges offer luxury car amenities; similar entry-level sticker prices; high durability and solid resale value.

Ram 1500 Crew Cab Advantages

Coil spring rear suspension; large easy-to-use infotainment screen; more rear-seat legroom with reclining seats; lower price; hybrid engines.

Nissan Titan Crew Cab Advantages

Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; off-road Pro-4X trim; standard driver and safety assists; long warranty.

Final Recommendation

While the Nissan Titan has plenty of power from its 5.6-liter V8, that alone doesn’t close the deal here. And while you have to work harder to find the right truck from the myriad of combinations offered by Ram, you’ll likely find something that closely matches your needs at a lower price.

Let&#8217;s see how they compare.</p><br /><h3><strong>2020 Nissan Titan<br><br /><img class=""alignnone wp-image-87423 size-large native-lazyload-js-fallback"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" alt=""2020 Nissan Titan"" width=""763"" height=""430""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-87423 size-large"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01-2020-nissan-titan-pro-4x-e1597348475756.jpg?w=763"" alt=""2020 Nissan Titan"" width=""763"" height=""430""><br><br /></strong></h3><br /><p><strong>2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab Starting Price: </strong>$40,485<strong> |</strong> <a href=""https://www.kbb.com/nissan/titan-crew-cab/2020""><strong>Price yours</strong> </a>or&#160;<strong><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/all/new-cars/nissan/titan/"">View listings near you</a></strong></p><br /><p><strong>Above Average:&#160; </strong>Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; good towing capability; available 4WD; serious off-road chops in Pro-4X trim, long warranty.</p><br /><p><strong>Below Average: </strong>Only one drivetrain offered; high entry-level price; aging chassis and design.</p><br /><p><strong>Consensus: </strong>Capable and refined, the Titan offers a powerful V8 as its only drivetrain choice. With a single wheelbase for crew cab models and only five trim levels, Nissan offers a much simpler approach to the new truck buying process.</p><br /><h3><strong>2020 Ram 1500<br><br /><img class=""alignnone wp-image-201112 size-large native-lazyload-js-fallback"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" alt=""2020 Ram 1500"" width=""763"" height=""430""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-201112 size-large"" src=""https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/763x430-5ycto-2020-ram-1500.jpg?w=763"" alt=""2020 Ram 1500"" width=""763"" height=""430""><br><br /></strong></h3><br /><p><strong>2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Starting Price: </strong>$33,590<strong> | <a href=""https://www.kbb.com/ram/1500-crew-cab/"">Price yours </a></strong>or <strong><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/all/new-cars/ram/1500/"">View listings near you</a></strong></p><br /><p><strong>Above Average: </strong>&#160;Styling; hybrid engine option; coil spring and air suspension; ride quality; rear-seat legroom.</p><br /><p><strong>Below Average: </strong>&#160;Upper trims get expensive; limited powertrain choices; 8- instead of a 10-speed transmission.</p><br /><p><strong>Consensus: </strong>The Ram offers a bold exterior without going overboard. It also offers numerous unique options like an air suspension and a massive 12-inch touch-screen infotainment setup. There&#8217;s plenty of powertrains and trims from which to choose.</p><br /><h3><strong>Titan vs. Ram 1500: Old newcomer or new oldtimer&#160;</strong></h3><br /><h3><strong>Nissan Titan Crew Cab</strong></h3><br /><p>Nissan has a short history of building full-size pickups. And yet its 2020 Titan, despite a recent facelift, is older than the newly redesigned Ram 1500. As a newcomer, the Titan brings some car-buying sensibility to the truck market. Rather than offering a confusing array of drivetrains, wheelbase lengths, and packages, the Titan is much more straightforward with a single 400-horsepower V8 and 9-speed automatic drivetrain, one wheelbase length and only five trim levels. While it makes things simple, it also limits your choice. At its entry point, the Titan is thousands more than the Ram. Titan does offer a wide range of equipment from the Spartan S model up through the plush Platinum Reserve. Of special note is the off-road 4-wheel drive Pro-4X version that offers serious off-road capability. Another plus is a standard suite of driver and safety assists.</p><br /><h3><strong>Ram 1500 Crew Cab</strong></h3><br /><p>The Ram, fresh off a 2019 makeover, offers handsome styling, an impressive number of trims and features, and improved towing and payload numbers. The base engine is a mild hybrid 3.6-liter V6 called eTorque. That same tech is available on the workhorse 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which helps boost that model&#8217;s fuel economy numbers. The big thing that separates the Ram from other pickups is its use of a coil-spring independent rear suspension. Even in base form without the optional airbag suspension, this setup imparts a great ride without sacrificing towing or load-carrying capability. We also like the user-friendly Uconnect infotainment system. Like the Titan, there&#8217;s plenty of upscale trims to turn your workhorse into a showhorse, but you&#8217;ll pay a pretty penny. Some of that investment will be returned due to the Ram&#8217;s proven durability and good resale.</p><br /><h3><strong>Similarities</strong></h3><br /><p>Expansive model ranges with rear- and 4-wheel drive; top ranges offer luxury car amenities; similar entry-level sticker prices; high durability and solid resale value.</p><br /><h3><strong>Ram 1500 Crew Cab Advantages</strong></h3><br /><p>Coil spring rear suspension; large easy-to-use infotainment screen; more rear-seat legroom with reclining seats; lower price; hybrid engines.</p><br /><h3><b>Nissan Titan Crew Cab Advantages</b></h3><br /><p>Standard V8 power; 9-speed automatic; off-road Pro-4X trim; standard driver and safety assists; long warranty.</p><br /><h3><strong>Final Recommendation</strong></h3><br /><p>While the Nissan Titan has plenty of power from its 5.6-liter V8, that alone doesn&#8217;t close the deal here. And while you have to work harder to find the right truck from the myriad of combinations offered by Ram, you&#8217;ll likely find something that closely matches your needs at a lower price.</p><br /><p><strong>Ready to buy a Nissan Titan or Ram 1500? </strong><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/""><strong>Shop now for one on sale near you.</strong></a></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab</strong><br /><strong>2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Popular Powertrains</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Engine<br />5.6 -liter V8<br />3.6-liter V6 Hybrid<br /><br /><br />Horsepower<br />400 hp @ 5,800 rpm<br />305 hp @ 6,400 rpm<br /><br /><br />Torque<br />413 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm<br />269 lb-ft @ 4,800 rpm<br /><br /><br />Transmission<br />9-spd automatic<br />8-spd automatic<br /><br /><br />Fuel Economy<br />18 mpg (16 mpg city/22&#160; hwy)<br />22 mpg (20 city/25 hwy)<br /><br /><br />Also Available<br />4WD<br />360 hp 3.0-liter turbodiesel; 395 hp 5.7-liter V8 and V8 hybrid; 4WD<br /><br /><br /><strong>Specs</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Warranty<br />5 years/100,000 miles<br />3-years/36,000 miles<br /><br /><br />Max Seating Capacity<br />6<br />6<br /><br /><br />Wheelbase<br />139.8 inches<br />144.6-153.5 inches<br /><br /><br />Overall Length<br />228.2-229.5 inches<br />232.9-241.8 inches<br /><br /><br />Width<br />79.5-80.7 inches<br />82.1 inches<br /><br /><br />Height<br />75.4 -77.2 inches<br />75.4-77.6 inches<br /><br /><br />Turning Diameter<br />48.0 feet<br />46.2 feet<br /><br /><br />Headroom, Front<br />41.0 inches<br />40.9 inches<br /><br /><br />Headroom, Rear<br />40.4 inches<br />39.8 inches<br /><br /><br />Legroom, Front<br />41.8 inches<br />40.9 inches<br /><br /><br />Legroom, Rear<br />38.5 inches<br />45.2 inches<br /><br /><br />Shoulder Room, Front<br />63.3 inches<br />66.0 inches<br /><br /><br />Shoulder Room, Rear<br />63.6 inches<br />65. 7 inches<br /><br /><br />Max Payload<br />1,580 pounds<br />2,000 pounds<br /><br /><br />Max Towing<br />9,350 pounds<br />7,620 pounds<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>",0.091,0.023,0.9898,fkD4tNPgvUeoegE4yEfnwm,,

You'll have to keep your eyes peeled to see all the clues in this video. It isn't until the end that we see a quick flash of a hand on what appears to be the Z Proto's new manual shifter. In another brief moment, the video also confirms what we already suspected: the Z will feature 300ZX-inspired taillights. A few days ago, Nissan design boss Alfonso Albaisa revealed a sketch of the thin, elongated lighting elements that provide a modern take on earlier Z generations, particularly the Z32 300ZX of the early 1990s.

Once again, we can see the Nissan Z Proto's attractive silhouette. The steep roof harkens back to the current 370Z, although the overall design is more fluid. A long hood, chrome strip on the roof, and sharp body lines contribute to the more streamlined look. We can clearly see design cues that reference the Zs of yesteryear, including the rounded headlights and the Z badge mounted on the C-pillar.

What remains unclear is the powertrain. The next generation may pack a 4.0-liter V-6 as rumors of a 400Z badge would suggest. Or it could get a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 from Infiniti's Red Sport 400 models. Since the upcoming reveal is a prototype, we may have to wait some time before finding out this information.","<div><p class=""_25GXi""><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nissan has dropped a new teaser video (below) that confirms that the Nissan Z Proto, and thus likely the production version that will follow, will feature a manual transmission&#8212;as hinted in an earlier teaser.

After stopping during the first safety car period without changing drivers, Fujinami was able to take advantage of clear air and gain ground before handing over to de Oliveira for the run to the flag, the Brazilian moving up from 12th to sixth at the finish.

However, Kondo was later stripped of the points it scored due to a 30-second penalty for an infraction at its first pitstop, applied for having the engine running before the car had been lowered from its jacks, dropping de Oliveira and Fujinami to 20th place.

De Oliveira said the rules breach was brought to the attention of the stewards by fellow Nissan GT300 team Gainer, whose #11 car moved up to sixth place as a result of Kondo's penalty and leads the points standings.

The long-time Nissan GT500 driver described the situation as ""annoying"" and ""sad"", and vowed not to help Gainer in its championship fight as a result.

""It was a good race, so it was a bit of a shock to hear afterwards that another Nissan team had made a claim,"" de Oliveira told Motorsport.com.

""It’s pretty annoying and quite sad that we get that reaction from a [fellow] Nissan team. They might need our help at the end of the season. They won’t have it. I hope we’re in a position to take it away from them.

""I don’t like that kind of behaviour, picking on small things. The result was already issued, but they went to the stewards and they claimed.

De Oliveira and Fujinami went into the Motegi weekend sixth in the GT300 points standings, but with their non-score have slipped to seventh, 24 points down on Gainer's championship-leading duo Katsuyuki Hiranaka and Hironobu Yasuda.

The Kondo duo qualified towards the back at Motegi after using wet tyres instead of slicks in their Q1 qualifying group on a drying track, unlike the majority of their rivals.","<div><p>De Oliveira and teammate Kiyoto Fujinami had recovered from qualifying down in 28th place in mixed conditions with a strong drive to sixth in the GT300 class, employing an unorthodox two-stop strategy in their #56 Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>After stopping during the first safety car period without changing drivers, Fujinami was able to take advantage of clear air and gain ground before handing over to de Oliveira for the run to the flag, the Brazilian moving up from 12th to sixth at the finish.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>However, Kondo was later stripped of the points it scored due to a 30-second penalty for an infraction at its first pitstop, applied for having the engine running before the car had been lowered from its jacks, dropping de Oliveira and Fujinami to 20th place.</p> <p>De Oliveira said the rules breach was brought to the attention of the stewards by fellow Nissan GT300 team Gainer, whose #11 car moved up to sixth place as a result of Kondo's penalty and leads the points standings.</p> <p>The long-time Nissan GT500 driver described the situation as ""annoying"" and ""sad"", and vowed not to help Gainer in its championship fight as a result.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>""It was a good race, so it was a bit of a shock to hear afterwards that another Nissan team had made a claim,"" de Oliveira told Motorsport.com.</p><p class=""ms-ap""></p><p>""It&#8217;s pretty annoying and quite sad that we get that reaction from a [fellow] Nissan team.

Nissan stays ready to adjust marketing strategy to everchanging realities

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For the first time, Nissan is bringing its popular “Heisman House” to college and professional football, one of several new twists as the campaign returns for its 10th season of star-studded shenanigans. Filmed under strict social-distancing guidelines, the Heisman House spots star eight Heisman Trophy winners including Tim Tebow, Kyler Murray, Charles Woodson and Lamar Jackson and feature the all-new 2021 Rogue alongside the Nissan Sentra, refreshed TITAN and Kicks.

“Over the past six months, Nissan has pivoted multiple times to adjust to new realities, and that agility has enabled us to come up with new and entertaining ways to reach our audiences,” said Allyson Witherspoon, vice president, Marketing Communications and Media, Nissan North America. “Case in point: the ‘It’s a Heisman thing’ campaign.

“While there’s no doubt that the 2020 college football season will look different, the humor, camaraderie and excitement of the Nissan Heisman House remain relevant, perhaps even more so during this time when audiences are craving some semblance of normalcy.”

The first two spots, “ It’s Heisman Time ” and “ Bird-watching ,” begin airing on September 12. And to ensure a wide reach for the Heisman House spots, Nissan is complementing its ad dollars with placements during professional football broadcasts beginning September 14.

“With less college football this year and six of the eight Heisman winners starring in the Nissan Heisman House spots currently playing professional football, it’s a natural redirection,” Witherspoon said.

The campaign brings former Heisman Trophy winners together under one roof where they rib each other incessantly and individually prep for the season they’ve all been waiting for to get underway. Other Heisman Trophy winners featured in the campaign are Marcus Mariota, Baker Mayfield, Derrick Henry and Mark Ingram. Making its TV debut is the all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue, which has all the technology, capability and functionality to make life easier for today’s families.

With its agency partner, TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, Nissan was diligent about taking safety precautions and enforcing social distancing among cast and crew on the Heisman House set, making for a shoot unlike any other. In scenes that made it difficult for the Heisman stars to socially distance, the crew filmed them individually on a green screen piecing the segments together in post-production.

In the spot titled “Anticipation,” Tebow is driving the Rogue, Nissan’s best-selling model in the industry’s largest segment, with Murray riding shotgun. The two filmed their portions of the spot separately, each addressing their lines to a tennis ball.

The spots will run on TV across ESPN, ABC, FOX and CBS. More content will be available on Nissan’s and ESPN’s digital channels including a 3D experience at the Virtual Heisman House as well as behind-the-scenes footage and bloopers from the shoot.

Looking forward, Nissan says college and professional sporting events will remain a cornerstone of its marketing strategy.

“College sports is the largest area of Nissan’s annual media spend, and we’re committed to sharing in the excitement with customers through content they love to watch,” Witherspoon said. “Come what may, we’ll adjust and innovate as we always do.”

Filmed under strict social-distancing guidelines, the Heisman House spots star eight Heisman Trophy winners including Tim Tebow, Kyler Murray, Charles Woodson and Lamar Jackson and feature the all-new 2021 Rogue alongside the Nissan Sentra, refreshed TITAN and Kicks.</p>  <p>&#8220;Over the past six months, Nissan has pivoted multiple times to adjust to new realities, and that agility has enabled us to come up with new and entertaining ways to reach our audiences,&#8221; said Allyson Witherspoon, vice president, Marketing Communications and Media, Nissan North America. &#8220;Case in point: the &#8216;It&#8217;s a Heisman thing&#8217; campaign.</p>  <p>&#8220;While there&#8217;s no doubt that the 2020 college football season will look different, the humor, camaraderie and excitement of the Nissan Heisman House remain relevant, perhaps even more so during this time when audiences are craving some semblance of normalcy.&#8221;</p>  <p>The first two spots, &#8220;<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZJluJvaEb1Qj7yDwgLhyilhCwYIl8MD00DKHJVkZ1hXgFeoH2HwYtze3fA5NJZh7rQupBcAkqItfFWNbwWdlXB2_GhU6VGs6n_DuNNOqUZ0="" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">It&#8217;s Heisman Time</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sThbVtea2NgFEJ4V8FCerRo8L5yNeQ6bKgiLea7WJAZo3GKO2UMk05Hjuux9JUB1SED3qpHLGrrWUQGG5FVOTA=="" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Bird-watching</a>,&#8221; begin airing on September 12. And to ensure a wide reach for the Heisman House spots, Nissan is complementing its ad dollars with placements during professional football broadcasts beginning September 14.</p>  <p>&#8220;With less college football this year and six of the eight Heisman winners starring in the Nissan Heisman House spots currently playing professional football, it&#8217;s a natural redirection,&#8221; Witherspoon said.</p>  <p>The campaign brings former Heisman Trophy winners together under one roof where they rib each other incessantly and individually prep for the season they&#8217;ve all been waiting for to get underway. Other Heisman Trophy winners featured in the campaign are Marcus Mariota, Baker Mayfield, Derrick Henry and Mark Ingram. Making its TV debut is the all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue, which has all the technology, capability and functionality to make life easier for today&#8217;s families.</p>  <p>With its agency partner, TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, Nissan was diligent about taking safety precautions and enforcing social distancing among cast and crew on the Heisman House set, making for a shoot unlike any other. In scenes that made it difficult for the Heisman stars to socially distance, the crew filmed them individually on a green screen piecing the segments together in post-production.</p>  <p>In the spot titled &#8220;Anticipation,&#8221; Tebow is driving the Rogue, Nissan&#8217;s best-selling model in the industry&#8217;s largest segment, with Murray riding shotgun. The two filmed their portions of the spot separately, each addressing their lines to a tennis ball.</p>  <p>The spots will run on TV across ESPN, ABC, FOX and CBS.

""I'm confident that I'm innocent,"" said Kelly, a former Nissan representative director, who is out on bail after his arrest by Tokyo prosecutors in November 2018.
""I would love to have him here as a witness because he could testify,"" Kelly said of Ghosn.
According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.
After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan.",20/09/2020,"By Noriyuki Suzuki and Takuma Obinata, KYODO NEWS - Sep 12, 2020 - 19:51 | All, Japan

Former Nissan Motor Co. executive Greg Kelly is confident that he can prove his innocence over alleged financial misconduct as his long-awaited trial begins next Tuesday in Tokyo -- without former boss Carlos Ghosn.

In an interview with Kyodo News, Kelly, 63, said he was ""not disappointed"" in Ghosn, who jumped bail and fled Japan in late 2019 to Lebanon, but he would like to have the former charismatic leader as a witness.

""I didn't violate any laws in Japan. This is a matter that, in my view, should have been resolved at Nissan. Nothing was ever promised to Carlos Ghosn. Nothing was ever paid to him,"" Kelly said in Tokyo a week before the trial.

""I'm confident that I'm innocent,"" said Kelly, a former Nissan representative director, who is out on bail after his arrest by Tokyo prosecutors in November 2018.

Kelly, who took the post in 2012, is accused of conspiring with Ghosn in underreporting the former boss's remuneration by around 9 billion yen ($84.8 million) over eight years through March 2018, in violation of Japan's financial instruments and exchange law. Nissan faces the same accusation as a company.

The prosecutors allege that there were deferred payments that Ghosn was to receive after his retirement, a scheme meant to avoid backlash to his high compensation.

""I would love to have him here as a witness because he could testify,"" Kelly said of Ghosn. ""This is a case about no promise and no pay. So I wish he was here.""

""But you know, in life, we all have to make our own decisions. And he made a decision he thought was best for him and his family.""

Kelly did not hide his frustration over the nearly two years that have passed since his arrest, saying he was ""snatched"" from his family in the United States. His planned neck surgery had to be delayed, and he has not seen his 9-month-old grandson.

""I don't think anybody in the world, for this kind of issue that should have been resolved at the corporate level, would want to wait two years in a country that's 6,000 miles from your family. Having to wait this long to even start a trial is very difficult,"" Kelly said.

Ghosn also faces a charge of aggravated breach of trust for his alleged misuse of Nissan funds, an accusation not leveled against Kelly.

Ghosn has claimed that his arrest was due to a plot by Nissan, which wanted to stop him from pursuing a merger with alliance partner and largest shareholder Renault SA, an arrangement the Japanese automaker feared would hurt its independence.

According to Kelly, Ghosn, who was in the unique position of knowing both automakers, maintained Nissan's independence so the Yokohama-based firm would not be ""overwhelmed"" by Renault.

""It was very important for him, for people at Nissan, especially people in Japan, to have pride in Nissan, their company,"" Kelly said. ""My view of his value was based on what the global marketplace was.""

In 2010, Japan started requiring top executives to disclose their annual remuneration exceeding 100 million yen. Ghosn's compensation, according to the prosecutors, totaled around 2.4 billion yen in the business year through March 2018, months before his arrest.

Kelly, who used to serve as the head of human resources at Nissan, said his relationship with Ghosn is not as close as the media have portrayed it.

""Carlos Ghosn is not my friend. I respect him, and I like him, but he was my boss. So, I don't know his family. We didn't go out and drink wine together.""

With his wife in Tokyo, Kelly is now preparing for a trial that he said would last about four months in the United States, by reading piles of documents. The prosecution had 84 boxes of documents, and the defense team is still waiting for 90 percent of these materials.

After months under what Kelly describes as ""house arrest,"" his trial is expected to take about a year in Japan. The proceedings will be held using consecutive interpretation, not simultaneous.

""I'm a person in life that's more of an optimist,"" Kelly said when asked if the truth would win out. ""So, I would hope it would.""

The Australian arm of Japanese car maker Nissan is looking to build on the name it made for itself launching the Nissan Leaf in 2012, outlining plans to launch a full electrified range locally by 2022 – and no model is off-limits. With any luck, these plans will kick off with the recently-announced Nissan Ariya which, according to Nissan Australia's managing director Stephen Lester, is high on the wish list. ""For us in Australia we have a strong feeling that this car would be perfect for our market,"" Mr Lester told CarAdvice ahead of World EV Day on September 9. ""It would make a lot of sense in that crossover segment – the most dominant segment in the market overall – as it appeals to the widest range of drivers, from those with families looking for utility, through to empty nesters."" While the status of the Ariya in Australia remains unconfirmed, CarAdvice understands that if it were to come here, the Ariya likely wouldn't arrive in showrooms until 2022, with a price point to compete with the Tesla Model 3 (which starts from $73,900 before on-road costs).

However, Mr Lester said Nissan would consider a ""basket"" of competing brands before positioning a local offering. Though the Nissan Leaf is the third most affordable all-electric car in Australia (behind the Hyundai Ioniq and the departing Renault Zoe), buyers may not necessarily benefit from entry-level pricing across Nissan's future electric offerings. ""Obviously the lower down the price band you are, the more potential people you have that can purchase your vehicle, but what is also important is that you deliver a vehicle that does what it says it's going to do,"" Mr Lester said. Regardless of whether or not the Nissan Ariya makes it to our shores, Australian consumers should expect almost a third of the brand's local portfolio to be electrified in two years' time. ""From an Australian perspective, we expect to have 30 per cent of our portfolio electrified by 2022,"" Mr Lester said, citing both full-electric options and Nissan's e-Power hybrid technology as part of this plan.

So, what kinds of electric and hybrid models are likely to debut over the next 24-or-so months? ""As far as concepts being worked on globally, there's not a segment we're not at least looking at,"" Mr Lester said. Even an electrified ute isn't off the table, although Mr Lester suggested this might be more of a task for the litany of start-ups targeting pick-up buyers with a penchant for electrification. ""I think there's no less than three brands – not mainstream automotive brands – that have been launching in that exact space,"" he said, referring to challenger brands like Rivian, Bollinger and Nikola. ""In Australia, [utes] play a very important role in the market and I have no reason to say we won't see electric utes.""

Last year, the company confirmed it will at least add a hybrid variant to the Navara ute at some point in the future, with the next-generation model. As for whether the pioneering Nissan Leaf will remain part of the portfolio, Mr Lester wasn't definitive on the compact hatchback's future in our market. ""We see EVs in all senses being the mainstay – whether or not it's specifically the Leaf as a nameplate, time will tell,"" he explained. ""To have EVs really become part of the mainstream we need more selection and more products people want to get behind the wheel of – for the vast majority of us [a car] is something you like people to see you in, it's not just a bare necessity.""

Mr Lester also shed light on how Nissan Australia plans to tackle some of the more common barriers to electric vehicle uptake in Australia – namely: higher prices, limited charging infrastructure and the ongoing debate over the green credentials of the cars themselves. ""What most industry experts say is that by 2024, or the mid 2020s, the cost of producing an electric vehicle will be equal to that of producing an ICE vehicle, and I think that still stays in our case in the market,"" Mr Lester said. ""From a production standpoint, we’d be able to price those vehicles fairly comparably."" However, he also argued the sheer amount of technology available in electric cars, along with their ability to feed power back into the grid via bi-directional charging, could come at a price premium. ""Even in today’s case it’s not fair to take a Leaf and compare it to another vehicle of a comparable size. No other vehicle on the market offers bidirectional charging, so how can I effectively price someone else’s hatch at the same price?""

On the contentious issue of Australia's largely coal-powered electricity grid, Mr Lester said there was certainly still room to improve. ""The reality is that in this country at the moment, coal is still a part of the grid, but that doesn't mean it will be forever. There's no question the government plays a huge role in that, compared to an organic movement of people,"" Mr Lester said. As for public charging infrastructure (or lack thereof)? ""We will continue to advocate for a strong improvement in that area – there's a certain ubiquity required so consumers can feel they can get a charge then they need to,"" he explained. ""But while the idea of a petrol station being on every corner has become the norm, a lot of us didn't grow up with a bowser nearby, so it's something that organically takes some time.""

Mr Lester acknowledges that while Nissan might have been first with the Leaf, the electric car market has since ballooned to include a slew of intimidating competitors – but he believes Nissan still retains its point of difference. ""Our production and engineering are what are going to differentiate us,"" he said. ""There’s no doubt that other brands will improve but competition is great, because it fuels everybody to get better and gives consumers more choice."" MORE: Everything Nissan

FRAMINGHAM – Crosspoint Associates has acquired a 2.75 acre site adjacent to its Whole Foods Marketplace on Route 9 in Framingham, allowing the Newton-based developer to proceed with plans to significantly expand the upscale grocery store.

Formerly home to the Colonial Nissan auto dealership, the property includes a 19,500 square foot showroom/office/flex space.

The deal was brokered by Bernard Gibbons of the Cambridge-based Associated Brokerage Group (ABG), who represented the seller, Empire Management Corp., and procured the buyer.

“Grocery-anchored shopping centers have been one of the few bright spots for retail during this health crisis, and the acquisition of the Colonial dealership allows Crosspoint to expand the size of the store and retain its anchor tenant,” said Gibbons. “The strategic location on Route 9, coupled with the value that a Whole Foods delivers to a retail center, allowed us to achieve record pricing for this parcel.”

This spring, Crosspoint indicated to the Framingham Planning Board that if the store was not allowed to expand to conform to the Whole Foods prototype, the grocer would need to seek a new location.

The deal keeps Whole Foods in Framingham.

The acquisition of the site allows Crosspoint to expand the retail center – which currently includes a Starbucks, TD Bank, Pilates studio, a waxing salon and one vacant retail space – by 14,089 square feet to 77,249 square feet, with the Whole Foods store expanding by 7,163 square feet to 43,617 square feet.

The former Nissan dealership would be home to a mixture of new retail spaces, including a new building for Starbucks complete with a drive-thru area.

The new retail center is being designed by HFA. Boston Real Estate Advisors principal Craig A. Barker represented Crosspoint Associates in the transaction.

Best Car Web claims the R35’s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.
Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.
These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.

Best Car Web claims the R35’s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.

According to the Japanese publication, the Final will be a collector’s items, with only about 20 units to be up for grabs with hefty price tags around the 40 million yen ($AU518,360) mark.

Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.

The Japanese publication also reports the Final’s engine will be based on that of the GT-R GT3 racecar, which suggests it could be the same unit used in the GT-R50 by Italdesign, a million-dollar-plus limited edition that marked the 50th anniversary of the nameplate.

In the GT-R50 by Italdesign, the GT-R's engine was upgraded with competition-spec turbochargers, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition and revised intake and exhaust systems.

These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.

As reported, Nissan is considering electrifying the GT-R by including a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the R36, similar to what was used in its ill-fated GT-R LM Nismo prototype from 2015.

The KERS system in the GT-R LM racecar fed energy to a pair of flywheels from the front brakes, and was able to send that energy to both the front and rear axles via independent driveshafts.","<div><p>Nissan is reportedly preparing a swansong for the R35 GT-R, with a limited edition to see the supercar off ahead of its R36 successor.</p><p><a href=""https://bestcarweb.jp/news/scoop/193233"" target=""_blank"">Best Car Web</a> claims the R35&#8217;s last limited edition will be aptly named Final, with it to be revealed sometime in 2022, while the R36 is expected to debut the following year.</p><p>According to the Japanese publication, the Final will be a collector&#8217;s items, with only about 20 units to be up for grabs&#160;with hefty price tags around the 40 million yen ($AU518,360) mark.</p><p>Each example of the Final will be fitted with a hand-built 3.8-litre turbo-petrol V6 producing a massive 530kW of power, Best Car Web says.</p><p>The Japanese publication also reports the Final&#8217;s engine will be based on that of the GT-R GT3 racecar, which suggests it could be the same unit used in the GT-R50 by Italdesign, a million-dollar-plus limited edition that marked the 50th anniversary of the nameplate.</p><p>In the GT-R50 by Italdesign, the <a href=""/nissan/gt-r"">GT-R's</a> engine was upgraded with competition-spec <a href=""/car-advice/what-is-a-turbocharger-36401"">turbochargers</a>, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition and revised intake and exhaust systems.</p><p>These mechanical changes delivered the 530kW (+89kW) and a colossal 780Nm of torque (+128Nm), outputs that could also be set for the Final.</p><p>As reported, <a href=""/nissan"">Nissan</a> is considering electrifying the GT-R by including a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) in the R36, similar to what was used in its ill-fated GT-R LM Nismo prototype from 2015.</p><p>The KERS system in the GT-R LM racecar fed energy to a pair of flywheels from the front brakes, and was able to send that energy to both the front and rear axles via independent driveshafts.</p></div>",0.067,0.027000000000000003,0.9081,DtTz3YJgouuSoJDTUFLQWM,,
300,300,300,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/Former-Nissan-executive-Greg-Kelly-pleads-not-guilty-in-court,Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly pleads not guilty in court,"TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.
In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.
The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.
The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court.
As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office.",15/09/2020,"TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.

The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.

In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.

The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year. The amount paid to Ghosn was allegedly underreported by 9.1 billion yen ($85.8 million) over eight years.

Nissan was also charged as a corporation for violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, to which the automaker pleaded guilty in Tuesday's hearing.

The biggest issue in the trial is whether money classified as ""unpaid remuneration"" actually exists.

The defense team for Kelly, a former representative director, claims the remuneration in question was not executive compensation, as it was planned to reward Ghosn for his services to Nissan after his retirement.

Kelly's defense maintains that even if there was an obligation to report the alleged remuneration, he cannot be held criminally responsible simply because of not reporting payment.

Two Nissan whistleblowers -- a former head of the company's secretary's office and a former company executive who is a foreign national -- previously reached plea bargains with the Special Investigation Department of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office.

But Kelly's defense team is poised to question the deals, claiming that the circumstances of how it was negotiated are unclear.

Prosecutors point out that the information disclosure system concerning executive remuneration of 100 million yen or more, which was introduced from the fiscal year ended March 2010, triggered an investigation leading to the scandal.

Ghosn had received more than 1 billion yen in annual remuneration, an amount he wanted to remain private, which lead him to allegedly order Kelly and other aides to find ways to avoid reporting part of the money.

According to the indictment, Kelly conspired with Ghosn to understate Ghosn's executive remuneration by a total of 9.1 billion yen in Nissan's annual securities reports from the fiscal year ended March 2011 to March 2018.

The Tokyo District Court plans 76 hearings until July 2021, including the first one on Tuesday.

More than 10 people -- including former Nissan President Hiroto Saikawa as well as the two Nissan executives who reached a plea bargain -- are expected to testify. No dates have been set yet for closing arguments or a ruling.

The first hearing is taking place in the largest room of the Tokyo District Court. It begins with Kelly's arraignment, in which the presiding judge questions the defendant.

Kelly, who is a licensed U.S. attorney, joined Nissan through the company's North America unit and became an executive managing officer in 2008. As an aide to Ghosn, Kelly was put in charge of the CEO office, the secretariat and the legal affairs office. He was promoted to representative director in 2012.

Kelly retained that position after he returned to the U.S. in 2015 until he was arrested in November 2018.

Since being released on bail in late December 2018, Kelly has been preparing for trial in the hope of finishing it as soon as possible due to a chronic health issue involving his neck.

He has already appeared for the pretrial arrangement proceeding, which was held behind closed doors. Reports say he grew visibly irritated over the slow pace of the proceedings.

Ghosn, who prosecutors allege to be the lead figure in the case, fled Japan by hiding in a box that was subsequently loaded onto a private jet and flown to Lebanon via Turkey. According to sources close to the situation, Kelly appeared surprised at the news of Ghosn's escape, saying he was not aware of it.

At a Beirut news conference he called in early January, Ghosn said Kelly was criminally charged because he refused to participate in what Ghosn described as a ""suspicious"" plea-bargaining agreement, unlike the two other Nissan executives who did.","<div><p>TOKYO -- Court hearings began on Tuesday morning in the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly over alleged underreporting of remuneration paid to Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's 66-year-old former chairman.</p><p>The 64-year-old Kelly was charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by making false statements in Nissan's annual securities reports.</p><p>In the hearing at the Tokyo District Court -- the opening salvo in the case against Ghosn -- Kelly pleaded not guilty.</p><p class=""ads__upper-inline-container""></p><p>The case has drawn global attention, despite Ghosn not being at the trial after fleeing to Lebanon last year.

While details regarding technical specs remain shrouded in mystery, Nissan does say the new Z car combines a “retro theme with modern technology” and that it “won’t disappoint.” Chances are the official reveal will technically involve a prototype given the use of “Proto” in the name, but it should be close to the real deal. The company took a similar approach in 2005 with the GT-R Proto, which looked almost the same as the production-ready R35 that arrived a couple of years later.

The fact it will be a prototype rather than an actual production model could mean Nissan is still putting the finishing touches on the 370Z successor. Connecting the dots, it might not hit the market until sometime next year, possibly as a 2022MY in the United States.","<div><p>Long overdue, but it&#8217;s finally here. Well, almost.

Yellow stitching is noticeable on the center console, but the do-it-yourself gearbox remains the main attraction in this brief video.</p><br />    <p class=""content-header""><br />        <h3 class=""mbn"">Gallery: Nissan Z Proto teasers</h3><br />    </p><br /><br />                <br />        <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/"" class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-main-photo-box""><br />                <br />                     <br />                     <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                <br />            </a><br />                        <p class=""msnt-photo-thumb-gallery-count""><p class=""value"">15</p> <p class=""label"">Photos</p></p><br />                    <span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177587/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177553/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_2.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177551/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_3.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177554/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_4.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177552/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_5.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5177550/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><span><br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <br />                    <a href=""/photo/5172004/nissan-z-proto-teaser/""><br />                        <br />                            <br />                            <img src=""https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg"" alt=""Nissan Z Proto teaser"" class=""desaturate"">                        <br />                    </a><br />                            </span><p>While details regarding technical specs remain shrouded in mystery, Nissan does say the new Z car combines a &#8220;retro theme with modern technology&#8221; and that it &#8220;won&#8217;t disappoint.&#8221; Chances are the official reveal will technically involve a prototype given the use of &#8220;Proto&#8221; in the name, but it should be close to the real deal. The company took a similar approach in 2005 with the <a href=""https://www.motor1.com/photos/619264/2005-nissan-gt-r-proto/"">GT-R Proto</a>, which looked almost the same as the production-ready R35 that arrived a couple of years later.</p><br /><p>The fact it will be a prototype rather than an actual production model could mean Nissan is still putting the finishing touches on the 370Z successor.

Likely to be powered by 1.0-litre naturally aspirated and turbo-petrol options.

Expect prices to start from Rs 5.5 lakh (ex-showroom).

It’s been a couple of months since Nissan unveiled the Magnite sub-4m SUV in concept form and we’ve only gotten glimpses of the production-spec model testing in extensive camouflage in India. Well now, leaked patent images reveal more on what to expect from the production-spec Magnite which isn’t too different from the concept. It’s slated to launch in 2021.

On the outside, the Magnite retains most of the concept’s bold design elements, especially at the front with a large single-piece front grille, sculpted hood, sharp headlights, and ‘L’ shaped LED DRLs. But once you get towards the overall silhouette, that’s where the differences lie. The SUV has a lower ride height than the concept which featured large fancy wheels. Also, the cladding has been slightly toned down. At the rear, the wraparound tail lights and integrated roof spoiler are retained with the bumper and cladding cleaner than the concept. It shares its CMF-A+ platform with the upcoming Renault Kiger sub-4m SUV.

The interiors are yet to be revealed but the concept showcases a minimalistic yet funky layout. It’s also set to be loaded with features such as cruise control, 360-degree camera and connected car tech. Expect more bits such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, climate control, and maybe even a sunroof. Safety kit could include around four airbags, ABS with EBD, and electronic stability control.

Under the hood, the Magnite could be powered by a 100PS 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 72PS 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine seen in the Renault Triber. A standard manual gearbox and a CVT option for the turbo-petrol motor could be the gearbox options on offer.

The Nissan Magnite is likely to retail from Rs 5.5 lakh onwards. It will take on the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport and Mahindra XUV300. There’s more competition on the way from the upcoming Kia Sonet, sibling Renault Kiger, and Toyota Urban Cruiser.
